It is so cool, it moves when you move (moderate speed, so don't run) and it zooms in and out (for example if you were in a room talking and someone else comes in it zooms out to catch that person and vise versa when that person leaves it zooms back in on you). Also if there is a sound in the background it concentrates on your voice so the person on the other line does not get distracted. Also on messenger you can tell stories (kids stories). Now for Alexa app, its good but not perfect let me explain more so it does pull up recipes and turns on and off the lights but it doesn't save the recipe like the other Alexa apps and it doesn't show you the feed to your cameras but other than that its great and very useful to not have you holding your phone all the time and can multi task while you're chatting... i love it. My advice to you if you dont use the messenger and whats up apps regularly it wouldn't be useful to you.

You link your Whatsapp account from your phone via the Whatsapp Web feature and it takes about a minute. You can then choose to add some of your Whatsapp friends/family to your Favorites so that they're on your home screen. You can also choose some of your Facebook friends as Favorites. This blends in your Favorites from both apps so that you don't have switch between the apps or even think about who uses what app. I think this is very useful and makes it much easier for anyone to use Portal. Your recent contacts also show up on the top of the home screen. The Smart Camera really is great and will amaze you with just how much better it makes video calls. The way it slowly zooms in to focus on you and anyone else in front of it is a lot of fun. You can stand up, walk around, or sit and just talk without thinking about looking at the camera. Currently, the Portal supports Facebook group calls with 8 people and Whatsapp calls with 4 if you call from the Portal BUT up to 8 if you're just getting an incoming group video call. (I checked with their support to make sure.) Zoom will support Portal at some later 2020 date. And for the times when you want to just make an audio only call, this works like a great speaker phone thanks to the advanced mics. Note that you currently can't talk to Portal to make an audio only call. (If you tap on a contact you always get the audio only or video call options.) There's a handful of apps but the most useful ones for most people are probably Spotify and Pandora for music. The speaker is in the back but it's surprisingly good and quite loud. You can ask ""Hey Portal, play The Beatles"" just like you would with a Google Nest Home or Amazon Echo. You can also use the CBS News and ABC News apps which are useful and just convenient. I can't comment on Facebook Video apps as I have no idea who watches anything on it. Is it the perfect well-rounded device? No. It has a few apps and Alexa integration so while it can set alarms, timers, and control your smart lights, it is probably not the best device for it. It's a little slow and all of that seems secondary. Is it nearly perfect for video calling on Facebook and Whatsapp? Yes. Especially for our older relatives that aren't always looking at their phones. This is the video phone from all those old movies and maybe that's all you need.","","Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger calls like never before","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERMCCEU53XGWUYEZ6JCEDHEJS7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29A4C35UM7FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

My previous experience with Alexa has been limited to the phone app, and a toy robot (Vector) that has Alexa integration. My overall impression is that this is a nice device for playing music, displaying photos, and interacting with Alexa, but not much else. The device is professionally packaged like higher end phones or tablets from other manufacturers. Initial setup is simple. You power on the device, connect to WiFi, do a firmware update that takes about 15 minutes, restart the device, then login to Facebook and Amazon. The device responds to two commands: ""Hey ..."" or ""Alexa"". Depending on which wake up greeting you speak, you'll either get Facebook or Amazon to respond. I have Amazon Prime, so the biggest feature I use the device for is playing Amazon Prime music by asking Alexa to play what I want. Amazon Prime music is nice, as it typically displays the lyrics and has a huge variety of music. I think the speaker has great volume and sound. It has a good sized speaker on the back of the device, so you get good sound that bounces off the walls back towards you. Volume controls are easily accessible on the side of the frame. The Portal can also connect to iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify to play other music or podcasts. (The bass is actually quite impressive for such a small device!) I also use the Portal to display photos from Facebook. You can select which photos you want it to display from albums, or your latest photos. If you install the Portal app on your phone, you can also add individual photos to show on your Portal device. I've tested a few video calls, but I don't frequently video chat with people. The sound was nice, and didn't capture an echo from the speaker like some other video chat programs do. The camera does follow you, but it moves very slowly. I have the Portal on my desk, and with the angle it was at, it often had the ceiling lights in the frame, causing me to move to one side to prevent too much light from being on the call. Pros: 1. Very good music playing device, with a large library of songs from Amazon, and others. 2. There is a cover that slides over the video camera, and when pushed further disables the microphone for privacy. 3. Displaying photos on the device is nice Cons: 1. There are very limited apps for the device. I'd expect it to come with a Facebook app or Amazon apps such as Amazon Music. You can login to Facebook via the browser, and you can control music with Alexa, but I'd expect these to be apps. You can also access YouTube via the browser, and they provide a shortcut for that, but again, not an app. There is also no built in weather app. You can display the current weather in your area on the main screen, but you can't see a forecast unless you ask Alexa to display the forecast. 2. The phone app currently has very limited functionality for loading photos, or calling your Portal device, or other contacts. No other functionality. 3. There is no cast capability for displaying content (music, photos, videos) from one device onto the Portal. A friend of mine has an Echo Show (or whatever the little round one is with the small screen) and I think it may be better (though a smaller screen).","","Good sound and screen.

So... don't have high hopes for ""hey portal."" Get it because you're an early adopter, or gadget-lover and because you're willing to lower your expectations in the short term. I honestly do have high hopes for this product in the long run, even though it's a bit embarrassing (or admirably bold in putting itself out there without being perfect?) in the first version. And since the problems are software/AI, I think there are few downsides to buying this now and watching the software evolve. The screen is gorgeous, and, at worst, it will be the best digital picture frame / video phone that is synced to your facebook account and can also play amazon music ... that you've ever owned. I really like the Portal, but I feel a sort of maternal need to pat it on the back and tell it to not give up despite its current challenges. Facebook Portal can be a dark horse. It's hard being such a late entrant to the game when people are used to Alexa and Google Home. But it stands apart because of it's superior screen/hardware and its integration with your facebook photos and contacts. That makes up for a lot. Manage your expectations --- expect the AI to be subpar - but the features and integrations to be awesome - and you'll be happy! My overall vote is that Facebook portal is definitely worth buying - but only second to an existing setup with Alexa or Google Home. It definitely can't compete as your primary in-home AI. Not yet. But it's worth adding on, if you can afford to. Could be a real solid contender by 2020.","","Buggy AI in first version - but lots of promise, and great integrations/hardware","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFCBN3HRL3ICU56QO4V3N32JVOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=99&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OMRJ5B7Z9CB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

On the good side, the Portal TV is a super handy way to video chat using your TV... once you finally get to the calling part. Unfortunately, the set-up process and user interface almost makes it not even worth it. Paired with the fact that Facebook locks you into their little messenger world... is not ideal. When I turned the device on for the first time, it needed a 40 minute software download. (I have descent broadband). Then it started to install, but I accidentally touched the back button on the remote, and it had to download the software update again, for another 40 minutes. All-in-all, device set-up took me 2 hours. Unacceptable. The user interface is clunky. Keep finding little glitchy things throughout that are frustrating. Searching contacts is hard, unless they are in your 'favorites' (which of course big brother facebook picks for you). The alexa integration doesn't add much, but it is nice to say ""Hey Portal, call John Doe"". There are cool features like games and mic drop and facebook watch, but they dont work unless the other side also has the same device, which nobody does. I have also found that not many people answer fb messenger calls, when you try and call. You have to text them first and let them know. For group calls, you cant schedule like a zoom and send a link. You have to create a room (which is super clunky) and hope people see it (which they dont). I read that it supports Zoom, but I dont see it in the available apps. The actual video call is pretty cool, since the camera pans and zooms auto-magically. Its very intelligent with its movements, even with multiple people moving around. But everybody I call is using their phone, and are in portrait mode (not landscape) and are moving around (cause... its a phone). I had envisioned more of a video conferencing feel like in the office on a big screen. But since it only works with messenger, which everyone has on their phone, its not a great experience. Dont recommend. Just too clunky and the software is disappointing for such a prominent company. The interface is like a prototype that a college coding class would make, with illegible fonts and oversimplified menus. Sad really. The exception would be if you plan to have frequent calls with someone else with a Portal, and you could suffer through the excruciating set-up and learning the clunky interface so you could just say ""Hey Portal, call Jane Doe"" when you want to use it. Then it might be OK.","","Disappointing.

It works pretty good but for my needs has just a couple of flaws. Video Calling - The video calling on this thing is where it stands out for sure. I have used Nest home devices and alexa devices and the technology that this has blows it all out of the water. Picture quality is great. It is nice that it adjusts as you move around. You can even add little filters to it while you talk which the kids love love love. My one complaint with this is that you have to use either Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. I wish there were more options and I wish you could communicate directly with other Alexa enabled devices. However, if you use Messenger or WhatsApp it is awesome. Alexa integration - The Alexa integration is pretty good but does have a couple of flaws. It can not communicate directly with other Alexa enabled devices which was a bummer as we have multiple devices throughout the house and like to use them to drop in and communicate which can not be done with this. Music - Sound quality is pretty good. One issue we had is that when it was playing pandora it would randomly just turn off the music after 15 or so minutes and we would have to ask it to start playing again. Kind of annoying and not sure what would cause it to happen but it happened all the time. Ring Integration - Worked flawlessly with our Ring doorbell. Which was awesome with the big screen that this device had. Apps - There are quite a few more apps available for this device then say an Amazon device. That was nice. Had Youtube and others built right in which was convenient for sure. Overall, these things are pretty awesome. We have enjoyed ours and it was well built. If it integrated with more methods of video calling and with other Alexa devices it would be a complete slam dunk in our household.","","Pretty solid device with a few things I wish you could change","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCP2TNAYCO364NXL2CLWQGFXHWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=77&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R93VAQTEOQ5ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

But the Echo still has more features than the Portal. So how you feel about it I think will depend on what features you‚Äôre looking for. The large screen of the Portal is an outstanding choice for those with limited vision. Small screens make seeing anything quite difficult for some, like parents and grandparents. So in this instance the Portal Plus is a far better choice than the Echo Show. What‚Äôs the point in video calls if you can‚Äôt even see the person on the other side? However for the tech types who like to have everything in their home integrated (turning on light, locking doors, controlling the thermostat, etc), or for those who enjoy the added features of the Alexa virtual assistant, the Echo Show has all that and more. But with a smaller screen. For myself, it‚Äôs hard to pick a favorite. The Portal is being updated with new features and if they continue to do so, it could be a real rival for the Echo Show. Especially with the huge screen. However Amazon could easily counter this by making a larger Echo Show of their own. As of right now, I have both. The Echo Show gets the most use. But if I struggled with seeing things on smaller screens, the Portal Plus would be the number one device I‚Äôd turn to.","","Portal Plus vs Echo Show.","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXGYD7YTDPTXBK6HYORZCCYZQ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=91&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R60K7GQ6S8BTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Doesn't support Apple Music, which most people have these days and only supports Spotify, iHeart Radio and Pandora..............with the exception of Spotify, most of the others are just not that useful.

Everything else portal does just makes it a glorified picture frame that updates directly from Facebook. It may be early on and this might be growing pains , but with the amount of competition from all the other video hubs Portal has some catching up to do. I‚Äôm also not a fan whatsoever of proprietary plugs so they loose points with their power jack. The outer body is a total finger print magnet which is another downside as touch is still a major way I interact with this still.

I bought this as a present for my mom to video chat with grandkids using Facebook messenger. -The device is very bulky, much thicker than I expected. -Too confusing to use ""Hey Portal"" and ""Hey Alexa"" on one device. Alexa cannot answer or make calls, only Portal can by saying ""Hey Portal."" I kept accidentally saying, ""Hey Alexa"", to make a call and it kept telling me that voice commands would not work on that device. -I tested a few calls, and depending on the other person's messenger app, sometimes it would call to the portal and sometimes it would only call to my phone. It also calls both at the same time. -You cannot use the portal voice command to call with WhatsApp, only Facebook messenger. -My device did not have a setting for using the device GPS to know when you are home, to route the calls to your phone instead when you are not at home. That was very confusing. I also did not see the option to switch the call from the portal to my phone during video chat. -The camera moving around and zooming in and out was pretty cool, but it also did think my Christmas tree was a person and it kept zooming in to keep both of us in the frame lol. Overall, it is too glitchy and not advanced enough for the price, in my opinion. Especially just for video chat since I can't see her using it for anything else.","","Too expensive for basically just video calls.","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHM7MIST5YGMFB7NH2OUKLLRS7KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=80&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JVZJ4ABSF3H0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The way the camera tracts people within it's field's range is pretty cool. And it's nice that now I have a large screen to see our grandchildren, but at times it seems a bit grainy compared to the first generation smaller portal I used to have. Also, I miss the touch screen capabilities of the original portal for doing things like selecting a subject to stay focused on. The available applications seems to be very limited as well. I could swear the 1st gen had a lot more apps to choose from. I do watch Amazon Prime through it, which so far works flawlessly, but it would be nice to have a browser, maybe utube.. or come on, this is a facebook product so how about facebook on it? I do have to admit that story time is a lot of fun with the youngest in our family. :) Alexa is OK on this.. handles my home automation OK enough, and MUCH clearer audio than my 3rd gen Echo Dot, but is a bit cumbersome in some aspects. If I want to see my Ring Doorbell video I can't just say to show me the front door. First I have to say ""hey portal, show me the home page."" This changes the HDMI port to the correct one for portal, as well as turn on the TV if its off. Once I have the portal screen showing then I can say ""Alexa, show me the front door."" and by that time I've already walked to the front door to see who's there. If I just tell Alexa to show me the front door it'll say OK, but nothing happens until I activate portal first. Frustrating. The HDMI-CEC control is also interesting. Yes, it will turn on my TV while switching to the portal port.. however; I can't use it to switch back to my cable-box's HDMI, control volume or turn the TV off. Perhaps there are commands to do this, but I haven't found them yet.","","Nice, but could be better.","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7IYKPOEKHKHI275AUXBH4EOB5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VO5CWYLM36MM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

You have to have a Messenger / Facebook account to use it. You can easily video call another messenger account or use WhatsApp. Picture is very clear and you can have multiple people on at one time. Great for seeing the kids and grandkids when they live in another state. You also have a browser on it so you can surf the internet with it and add bookmarks / apps as needed. It has story time on it and the grandkids loved it. As it tells the story they are actually in the story, this is done by using the camera. They had a blast with it. I had a blast watching them laugh and point at themselves in the story book. Great memories. As for privacy when you are finished with the video chatting, just slide the camera and microphone switch to off. A plastic cover will hide the camera. You can still use all the other functions. We play music with it which comes in clearer than the radio. I especially like the camera, it follows you around the room and will either zoom in so the others can see you or if you sit real close to it the camera will adjust itself to pull away from you. No more moving whatever device you use back and forth so people can see you. We had three people on one call and we could see them with no problems. It does show your surroundings so make sure no one sneaks up behind you in their skivvies. The camera will pick up other people behind you. I really did not see anything about it that I did not like. We will get good use out of this. I am glad we got this. It is an easy way to see the family and keep up with what is going on. When you visit the family there is no more comments like ""look how much you have grown"" or ""changed"" etc. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to see the kids across the country or just for everyday use. I hadn't seen my brother in over a year and now we talk with this and it like we are in the room with each other.

We're talking heads which are 3-4 feet tall on her screen when we video chat with her. And it's in her living room where she normally sits. This permits her to see her family. Priceless. But it's really hard to set this device up for her so she can easily use it. Grandma has terrible vision and is really really bad with gadgets, especially remote controls. Asking grandma switch video inputs on her TV remote as opposed to her normally used satellite TV remote is beyond ridiculous. The Portal TV remote is so small I don't think she can even see it. Besides, the buttons on it a camouflaged by being the same color as the case. Even I couldn't see the buttons. Also, another small remote is guaranteed to be lost within a day or two. So using the Portal TV remote is not an option. Her TV wasn't new enough to auto-switch to the Portal TV HDMI feed when answering a call (ie. when Portal answers a Facebook video call). And even if it was, the TV wouldn't auto-switch back which would effectively disable her TV watching. That's her main entertainment in life right now. Cutting it off is beyond unacceptable. So instead I bought an HDMI auto-switch (HDMI Switch SGEYR 5x1 HDMI Switcher 5 in 1). But the Portal TV device doesn't turn off it's HDMI output after it hangs up on a Facebook video call, so the HDMI switcher won't auto-switch back to her TV channels. I ended up setting up a powerstrip on the table near where she sits. The Portal TV device gets it's power from the powerstrip. Before we want to do a Facebook Portal video call with her, we call her on the phone and tell her to turn on the powerstrip (it's big enough that she can see it). We wait two minutes for the Portal TV device to powerup, then we call her on Facebook video (note, you have to use ""Messages"" in Facebook.com. The Facebook Messenger app on Windows doesn't seem to have a video call option. Yeah, that's not confusing). She answers by saying ""Hey Portal, answer"" and then once connected, ""Hey Portal, camera on"". So I got it to work, but is was a huge hassle to setup. The Portal TV device really needs an HDMI switch that can switch to Portal TV video to answer a Facebook video call, then auto-switch back to the TV when done. Call Quality: My mom has old DSL internet service that is pretty slow. Her Portal TV device is connected via good strength WiFi (there is no ethernet port). Portal TV does a very good job of handling the low bandwidth connection. She sometimes looks a little grainy/pixelated, but the video and audio never drop out. She says that her image of us looks very good. The microphones on the Portal TV device seem to do a good job of locking in on her voice. The Portal auto-zoom on person talking seems to work fairly well, but it occasionally decides to zoom in on Grandma's walker, rather than grandma. But it's smart enough to keep grandma in the frame, so it's mostly humorous rather than a real problem. In summary, really cool device that does a good job handling low bandwidth connections and looks fantastic on the big screen.","","Portal TV let's us talk to grandma!

When I originally received it, I was surprised at how tall it is. Attached to this review is a photo showing the box sitting next to my iMac. When you take it out of the box, you can tell this is NOT a cheap plastic device. Some tech you get, you feel it will break in two weeks. This device is not like that. It has a very solid feel to it. Visually it looks like a white (or black) pillar with an iPad glued to the front. One thing that's kept video chat from being a reality in my opinion is the fact that you either have to have your face buried in your phone (FaceTime) or in front of a computer (Skype). Those work well enough, but still generally lean towards people who are more ""tech-y"". The commercials on TV for this device speak to a decidedly ""non-techy"" market with the ""The Ugly Sweater Party"" type commercials. Breaking into that kind of market requires a device like this, not video chat on a phone or computer. Overall the Portal device is a cool idea. I love video chat, as I moved about 1,400 miles away from my blood family awhile ago for work. So video chat is a big deal to us. The ability of this to keep track of the person talking is nice. The real world experience of it is not as slick as the TV commercials - too much moving and it pixelates a little. Not a lot, but it's not as crystal clear as the advertisements show. Still, it's one of the major selling points of the device, and it works well if not perfectly. I remember hoping that my Xbox with Kinect would pull this off, but it never really did - not like this. This works a lot better than that experience if you remember that. You can also do goofy stuff like put a cat on your head when you chat. I suppose for the ""grandma and grandkids"" chat selling point of this it might be a laugh, but will anyone REALLY use this feature beyond once or twice? Probably not. It is sold as having Alexa functionality, which it does to an extent. But it is not full featured. Some of the things like multi room audio and groups aren't there. You can't ""drop in"", and announcements aren't there. Some of the basic Alexa functionality is. Whether this affects your opinion of the device would depend on what you have done with other Echo devices, or what your expectations were here. For me, it's not a dealbreaker, as I have actual Echo devices in the same room, so I don't need that stuff. I would however like the ability to look at my Ring cameras (Amazon Echo Show devices can do that). That is not available and it would be nice if the portal was tied into that and you could use it to see what's going on at your front door with the doorbell out there. Hopefully this gets added before too long. It does have the ability to show photos from your (and your friends) Facebook posts as ""screen savers"" as such. That's pretty cool, but if your friends are the kinds who post obscene pictures or blue humor stuff, you might get a shock on your screen. :) There is a Facebook watch app, which is nice if you use Facebook's watch feature. I do for the live MLB streaming games - or I did in the 2018 season. As I write this in early 2019, I do not know if that's happening again, but I can easily see myself watching Facebook's MLB game streams on this. One thing I wish it would do is let me use its screen as a ""second monitor"" for my main desktop computer, and then interrupt me if there's an inbound call. Problem with that is there's no cable input, you'd have to bluetooth over or something along those lines. It's not nearly as cool having a Portal device in my house if the person on the other side has their face buried into their phone - which turns this into a SERIOUSLY oversized and overpriced FaceTime device. You might be better off with an Amazon Echo Show in that case. But it does what it exists for (video chat) it does extremely well. I just don't see it being your SOLE device of this kind (mostly due to the ""Hey Portal"" stuff being weak compared to existing AI (Alexa, Hey Google, Hey Siri).. This works well as a secondary device if you already have some other kind of home device of this nature. The likely target for Portal is those who already use Facebook messenger to communicate with their friends regularly. Are there enough people like that to sustain this as a product? I don't think so. I do wonder about the ""Facebook effect"" - given their issues with privacy and selling info (Cambridge Analytica), one wonders if that will impact widespread adoption of the device. I'm not one to go all George Orwell here, I do like tech. But Facebook does have a reputation for this kind of thing and ""selling you"" (whether they are or not is not my point - I'm talking reputation here). If this device were from someone else, I wonder if it would change anything in terms of perception. There is a way to cover the camera - it comes with a small cover for that. Still, in this age of social media (and Facebok's own 30 million user account info breach/leak), perception seems more important than reality, so I wonder how much of an impact all this will be. Will people want a video screen with a camera that looks into their home? Bottom line is this is an impressive piece of tech and works REALLY well for video chat, but needs a lot more work if it wants to grow beyond being a niche product.","","REALLY great if you like Facebook Messenger chat. Beyond that it needs work.","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5ABAZHI4DK6FDGZWHDK6XBYSSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=96&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MZVNJEQ41EP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

We spoke with Michael and his response was that the engineers are working on making the portal TV work with Zoom... We researched and read all available information. Once we received the camera, we set it all up and we cannot find the Zoom app anywhere! Then we searched for a 'work around'. Yep, it says just use the browser to access Zoom. We searched and searched... no browser to be seen. The portal TV is supposed to have an app for Zoom and it does not.

So if yiu say alexa call mom, it will tell you it is not supported and tell you to use your phone app. But if you say hey portal call mom, it will call mom and search via their name on fb messenger. The camera follows you but not as fast as it advertises on their commercial or video example. Video quality is legit. Perfect for a toddler that runs around and for the grandparents to enjoy watching him play versus a phone moving around all the time. No more video calls with them looking up his nose or facing the wall. Lol. Really enjoying this product and use it mostly for music and video calls so far. There aren't that mant apps for it yet.

At first it was ok, we could make calls and it also worked as a picture frame. Soon after we got it though I would walk by and see that instead of the picture I chose it was a suggestion to fb call my mother-in-law. Over and over I had to exit out and put my picture back up. After that my picture would randomly be missing and it would be one of the fb stock photos of nature. My picture was still listed as the active picture so I‚Äôd have to delete everything and reupload. Again, the main reason I bought this was to act as a digital frame. A few weeks ago the portal started going black. I‚Äôd have to restart it, sometimes twice a day. Finally today it shut off and it seems to no longer work. I tried restarting it and all I can get now is the Portal screen.

No jabber, no Alexa calls, no skype, no sip, no google. Nothing. - device recognized by a phone as a bluetooth speaker. You can't use it as a speakerphone with you cell. - you can't call a regular phone number (even with a fee). - it doesn't support Webex meetings. Helpdesk says that they're working on it, but no ETA. Webex (via website) does not recognize microphone / speaker, or camera. No MS Teams support, no google meet. - do you want to use it as a photo frame? Only with your facebook photos. - very few applications. 10? Useful? 2-3 max. - no email client, no calendar. Yes, you can open outlook 365 or gmail in a web browser but this is not the case. - Alexa on this device is handicapped.

It is super easy to use and my 5-year-old now can call me from home while I am at work. Do note that I am using this only for portal to portal calls. I do not use this to call through any other device. In that regard, it is flawless. The only reason I gave it one * off is that the portal + is fairly big and conspicuous. Unlike the smaller device (which I also have), this is awkward to place and takes up a lot of space due to its unusual size. The smaller portal device is perfect and I would strongly recommend that be your first purchase. I have used this with one device in my office, one device at home and one device at my parents. This truly enables us to all communicate flawlessly and is fantastic in that regard. Please ignore people who are rating this device solely on the company's actions. The goal should really be to rate the device and how functions and performs. Having said that, I do notice unusual activity with reviews.

In this regard, it's amazing. The screen is gorgeous, the microphones work great, and the camera tracks your movement. It's like a simplified enterprise teleconferencing setup for the home! Setup was refreshingly simple. It lacks a ton of features, and for now it's pretty much dependent on Facebook Messenger for calls, but Facebook being what it is, that's not exactly proprietary. The camera tracking your motion really makes this a device you can put on a table or counter and engage in conversation as you naturally walk around. That's the real benefit vs using a phone, laptop, or tablet--your hands are free. It's so much more natural, and it is a real blessing for families that are separated, especially those around the world. My sister in-law was able to connect with family in Brazil, and it felt so much more natural than traditional WhatsAp or Facebook calls on a phone. As a ""smart device"", it's a bit raw. The speakers are solid, as is the screen, but the Alexa implementation is incomplete vs Amazon devices. I'd suggest this for someone who doesn't have Alexa, or at least doesn't have it in the area near this device. If you're cross shopping this with an Echo Show, get the Echo Show.

So when the Portal TV came out I got one for myself and one for my parents as soon as I could. It was fairly easy to setup both for me and for my parents (with a little help from me over the phone). Once or twice per call the AI camera focus will randomly wander off and highlight an empty corner of the room, but otherwise the video and audio quality are good. The voice navigation is great; I can turn it on, make a video call, hang up at the end of the call, and turn it off all with voice commands without touching the remote. It also plays Netflix and Amazon Video and some other things, but those don't support voice commands, so we just stick with using our PS4 for those like we did before we got the Portal TV. Facebook recently added Zoom support to every Portal EXCEPT the Portal TV, which is frustrating; maybe Zoom is working on their own set-top camera and didn't want Portal TV to compete. It would also be nice to be able to use Skype or Hangouts on the Portal TV, but obviously Facebook wants to keep everything within their own ecosystem and support their competition as little as possible. Another minor annoyance is that the remote has an accelerometer that's not used for anything, but if you nudge the remote (or nudge a table that the remote is sitting on) then it'll wake up the Portal TV. Although my parents and I call each other directly from one Portal TV to another, it can call anything that can run Facebook Messenger video, so you can also use it to video chat with someone via their phone, or computer with webcam, or non-TV Facebook Portal device. It also has a black plastic shutter that you can slide over the camera to make extra sure that Facebook isn't randomly spying on your living room while you're not using it, if that's a concern you have. So far there's still zero competition in the ""webcam with built-in video chat that you just connect to your TV"" market, so if you want to be able to video call people from your TV and don't mind being tied to only being able to make video calls via Facebook Messenger, then this is the device for you.","","good at what it does, but doesn't do a lot","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFR5GX6DLHNSEJJTLHJMCWQL5ADQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OJW1YCKHWU6V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

A red light appears to indicate that they are turned off. I have been using various video calling equipment and apps for almost 15 years and the Portal is the best yet and definitely the easiest to use. After plugging in the Portal, one only has to log in to their FB account and their messenger contact list immediately appears. A green circle indicates which of the contacts is currently active. The person called by the Portal only needs to have a messenger app on any device in order to receive the call. The picture that one sees on the Portal will depend on the quality of that person‚Äôs device camera. Video calling with someone who also has a Portal or has Messenger installed on a device with a high end camera, like the Pixel 4 or iphone 11 is definitely optimal. The Portal makes it easy to do group calls too. There are fun effects that one can use during the call or in the photo booth which can capture both still photos and videos that can easily be sent to friends. The clarity and color of the transmission are spot on but the biggest advance is the ability of the camera to follow someone as they move about a room. One can also select an individual to spotlight which is nice, especially when there are several people in the room. The capacity of the camera to pan and zoom as needed is so impressive and makes video calls feel more like an actual visit. The Portal even automatically adjusts the volume as one moves farther or closer to the device. The sound quality is excellent and the calls are crystal clear without someone having to ask for things to be repeated. Alexa is built into the Portal and is designed so that one doesn‚Äôt have to go through the ‚Äòhey Portal‚Äô wake up but instead can just say ‚ÄòAlexa‚Äô. This is a handy way to control smart home devices or use various Alexa skills. I was happy to see a quick response when I asked Alexa to stream my Wyze video cameras. It‚Äôs easy to link the Portal to an Amazon account. There are also other built in apps and website icons including YouTube, Google search, Facebook and numerous news outlets and popular apps and sites. A WhatsApp can also be linked in settings. The ten inch Portal is designed to look like a solid and attractive picture frame that can be used in either landscape or portrait mode. The 4.75‚Äù stand gives it a firm footing in either orientation. It doesn‚Äôt appear that the Portal is designed to compete with either the Amazon Echo or the Google Hub. Each device has its own unique features and abilities. The Portal by Facebook will be best appreciated by those who use FB Messenger and/or WhatsApp as their primary social media source. For users of those apps, the Portal is an excellent choice for high quality video calls. Giving a Portal as a gift to a family member who is not technically proficient but would like to have the ability to easily have a virtual visit with friends and family is a wonderful choice. Portal from Facebook is easy to use, has privacy settings to minimize concerns and makes video calling a five star experience. Everything else about it is just a bonus.","","Excellent design for FB Messenger users","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHH53Q3XLBEEPK36DLJ5UDEVZM5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REWWYJR07IRGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

So far I really like it, the video and sound quality is top notch and all the Alexa things I have tried work well. Even the screen saver mode that shows your Facebook photos comes in handy. UPDATE: after using it a few days I pretty much feel the same as above EXCEPT after some checking and asking questions, many more advanced Alexa features like messaging, drop in, viewing Ring/Blink and other cameras, connected speaker system to sync with other Alexas might never be coming. So my thoughts of calling this the best Alexa device could change as its really only the basic Alexa commands in it. UPDATE: I hate to say it, but I am returning this in favor of the 2nd gen Echo Show. $400 after tax and all is a lot to put out when it lacks so many Alexa features and skills I mentioned in my other update. Unless you really really really and I mean REALLY video chat a lot thru Facebook, the 2nd gen Echo Show is just a much better Alexa device in almost every way plus you can still video chat with it, just the camera does not follow you. $375-400ish after tax and all, I can't just wait and hope to see what is going to be added. I can always buy it again if it ever becomes a better Alexa device.","","Nice built quality, great screen and sound, but lacks most of the advanced Alexa features.","418","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFG4TI357GOLNHTLXRWIKCFHD5KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=101&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V8EKYVQHGR6L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Starting with few cons, i wished it would work without being plugged in all the time, so maybe if it had some kind of battery. I also wished it had some kind of voice recognition / face detection for security purpose. Also the incoming calls in facebook not always goes to portal. Now with the pros, It's basically facebook video caller that is always active. The best part is the camera focus and movement. It's smart and detects the person that is moving. With the integration of Alexa, i can view through my ring doorbell as well which is really nice. The picture slideshow that happens automatically from the pictures in facebook or instagram is also a great addition. It has browser as well so you can basically do anything related to web from there. Integration with whatsapp also expands its feature.

Wolters","","","Color: Black | Style: Portal Plus","B07HFWG8S4","https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/product-reviews/B07HFWG8S4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format","5.0","December 15, 2018","United States","Video Conferencing used to be something we‚Äôd only see in Sci-Fi stories. From Star Trek‚Äôs view screen, to the ‚ÄúBell System‚Äù video phone booth in 2001: A Space Odyssey, those scenes and moments were something dreams were made of. When video chat started to make its way to our PC‚Äôs in the 90s, I was really excited. While it wasn‚Äôt seamless and you really had to work at finding someone, anyone to chat with, it truly was exciting times. Flash forward to now where we take video conferencing for granted and there are now so many options. From Skype, to Apple‚Äôs Facetime to Google‚Äôs really underrated Duo, we have more options than ever. Beyond the little known video conferencing options with the Microsoft Kinect, nothing has come close to innovating like the Facebook Portal Plus. The first thing you will notice about the Portal Plus is the awesome packaging. Everything is easy to open and clearly marked on how to open. You even get a nice ‚ÄúHi‚Äù in the box. Right away, everything screams quality and something special. You also get a camera cover if you want more peace of mind when not using the camera. That said, you will be able to mute mic and turn of camera by a button. Setting up the Portal Plus is also so very easy. You are directed to a website to enter a code and you must use Facebook Messenger. Once that is setup, the rest is easy and it takes over and completes a few more setup steps and it is ready to go. The primary screen is your video calling page, where it suggests friends to call. At first, mine was suggesting people I never once sent Facebook Messages to but it has finally set to mostly family suggestions, which is perfect. The second screen features a handful of apps you can use but more on that later. Video calling. It is what the Portal is all about, right? I will go ahead and say this now. This is the best video conferencing device that I have ever used. Period. No doubts about it. I thought Skype with the XBOX One and the Kinect was awesome. But this truly blows me away. The video and sound are just so crisp and clear. Everyone we tested with were equally impressed and they were only using their phones. On the Plus, you can also rotate between portrait and landscape mode and it is a joy to use. Landscape is my favorite mode. Smart Camera is truly something to behold. As mentioned, I used the Kinect with Skype and it has some tracking but not like the Portal has. Smart Camera truly can follow you across an entire room. I tested this in my living room and you can go end to end and it can still track you. It also focuses on the speaker and can help drown out background noise so that the receiver can hear the primary speaker. Also, it can frame a shot so if there are multiple people in the frame, it works hard on making sure it looks great and proper focus to both people in the foreground and background. Smart Camera is the true selling point of the Facebook Portal. There are some apps and features worth mentioning. The story time mode is so cute and perfect for grandkids sending their stories to their grandparents. Just love this feature. It also has a few music apps such as Pandora, Spotify and I Heart Radio. You can also let it show a slideshow of your photos from Facebook. While not as good as what you can get on a Google Home Hub device, this works fine. I‚Äôd like to see some updates to the slide show, like being able to select ALL photos and a better randomizing algorithm. At the time of this review, there was a new update released but I‚Äôve not received it as of yet. It is to include a browser among other good enhancements. Amazon Alexa integration works well though it isn‚Äôt as full featured as what you will get with a full Echo device. I was able to ask question, reorder items from Amazon and general use and it worked great. There are so many options these days for video conferencing platforms and devices. If you and your family are Facebook Messenger users, I have to wholeheartedly recommend the Facebook Portal. Not only are you staying on a common messaging platform, but you are getting the absolute best camera you can get.","","Best Video Chat Camera Ever","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKPKKYN6747GTCEC62R5FNJDZDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCE95MDZDF48V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

There is one easy and obvious solution to this, and why Facebook hasn't implemented is beyond me: I suspect many users may have an Alexa audio-only unit nearby, and why given the Portal TV already has Alexa integration there isn't a (user settable) option to announce WHO is calling on Alexa is inexplicable. But at the moment the ony way (unless you have a cell phone or PC at hand) to find out WHO is calling is to answer it on the TV. Alexa alaready has this integration for landline phones if you buy the Amazon Alexa phone interface, so why FB chose not to also allow this for Portal is beyond me as the hard work (Alexa integration) is already done.","","Pretty Amazing Device with one Glaring Misfeature: no effective ""caller id""","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGOX47JWHVOQK6MI6AN4FL3OJ3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UE6UA6UKZPBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It has exceeded my expectations and brought more functionality into my living room than before. Small example, alexa cant turn on my tv with a voice command, portal can. The quality is great, video and sound and its a great experience being able to sit on the couch and have a conversation as if me and the person i called were in the same room. Its more personal and you are not holding a phone in your face for the duration of the call. Lets talk privacy real quick, yes it has a camera cover and a mic mute button. If you are still paranoid about facebook tracking your living room activities you better throw your smartphone in the trash cause i have news for you, in the age of technology you are being passively monitored 24/7. Not saying giving them more access is good but dont kid yourself if you think you are off the grid by any means. I gain far more from this than they do, so the risk vs reward is mitigated. My biggest complaints/ recommendations so far. 1. It would be great to have the camera lens open remotely at the push of a button. A little motor that moves the lense physically so i sont have to get up to open/ close it for each call. 2. It be great if it had hand gesture tracking to zoom in or out. Trying to show off an object can be a bit annoying trying to fit it in the frame when it focuses on your face. 3. It doesnt track all family members, especially the ones that bark. It would be nice if my dog was tracked to so it would put him in the frame when hes on the couch with me. 4. This ties into point 3. It would be great if we could pick certain callers that will automatically answer the call. This way you could set it up to check in on your pet to. Say im out and about, i call the camera itself, it turns on the tv and automatically answers for my predetermined number. Lastly, and this is my biggest issue with portal TV, its not as international yet as it should be. I think this is a matter of time but its still a huge issue. Many countries do not have this available yet so when i call there they are still bound to holding a phone in their face. I know more EU countries are being added soon but there are still many that arent. I hope this gets addressed soon. Anyways, overall this product is perfect if you live thousands of miles from loved ones. if you live locally however, just be a decent person and meet in person.","","Portal TV: perfect for international living","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCOITJU4YNSCSDCVAP2WTP66MQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MGBJ3FDL96CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I tried it out first, and it worked very well when I called my friends and family who ALREADY had a facebook. So before Christmas, I unboxed the two for my grandparents and started the process of making a facebook for them. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a way to add facebook contacts using whatsapp (because a whatsapp account was much easier to set up), but I wasn't concerned because I had already made new emails for both of my grandparents for their google home accounts. BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW! In all of facebook's infinite wisdom, both emails were rejected and their accounts disabled before I could even get to the part of adding a picture for them. Don't know why, all it said was that somehow my 100 year old violated the community guidelines. I immediately clicked for facebook to do a review, there must be a mistake. Facebook said they would gladly do a review if I provided a phone number they could text. HOW DOES A 100 YEAR OLD RESPOND TO A TEXT?!?! and of course I can't use my phone because it's already attached to my account. So what do I do here? There is no number to call, no help desk to complain. Facebook sells this product on being a great easy way to communicate with the elderly, but does nothing to make it easy to get set up. I literally have no idea what to do other than keep trying different emails until maybe the great facebook will be gracious enough to let me video chat with my Grandparents.","","Good Luck Adding a Grandparent","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDZSHDQTSI6ABTSMPK73KHFWSHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R191CBP1ZVH7EF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Main issues: * Audio quality is not that good on high range, and the sub range is much better and stronger, so it feels uneven. * AI is super week. If it's the Superframe's (screensaver) algorithm of choosing my Facebook pictures, or the quality of the assistant, even lower than the stock Alexa.

I bought this device so I could take video calls from my living room TV. Facebook promoted their support for Zoom, which is what I use for most video calls. Then when the Portal TV arrived, I was dismayed to find that Zoom support is for all Portal devices EXCEPT the Portal TV. Damn. - Cannot use if you're smart TV is hooked up and using HDMI-CEC and ARC. I have an Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV which are hooked into my LG TV via HDMI. I can use one remote for all of them, they turn on/off automatically, and audio for all of them goes into the TV and back out via one HDMI cable to my Yamaha Receiver. It works perfectly, until Portal TV is plugged in. I tested multiple HDMI ports and switching them up, and it's definitely the Portal TV. When it's plugged in my TV cannon send audio to the Yamaha receiver via ARC and the CEC communication is blocked, so auto-input switching and auto on/off no longer works. I read many other users having this same problem, and Facebook told me they're aware of the problem and working on it. PROS - Good video quality. I've had a few video calls with family and friends via WhatsApp on the Portal TV. They all told me the video quality they're receiving of me was very good. There is an option to switch landscape/portrait mode, and this is helpful for people calling me via their phone...as the portrait mode crops the video and gives them a closer view of me and yet is still a good resolution. - Auto-zooming / following. Generally this works pretty well, and makes it more convenient for me to be natural in my environment...getting up and walking around and yet the other party still sees me in the center of the frame. - Privacy shield/button. Good for them on including this. Easy to cover the camera and also hit the side button to disable audio/video. UNDECIDED - Audio quality. So far I have not been able to successfully use audio through the TV. There is about a 2 second delay which makes the calls unworkable. I was able to connect the Portal TV to my Bluetooth headset and this was satisfactory. I'm not sure why the 2 second delay, and this could be a problem if you need to use the Portal TV through speakers vs. using a Bluetooth headset.","","Zoom does not work.

My original comments still apply. The video call is it's main purpose and best use case. It's still loud and the camera is awesome as it pans to where there is motion or voice. It does work from 25-30 feet away. We have it on continuously so the portal updates itself occasionally. We have had to do a couple reboots in this 1.5 years but in general it works. They did add one capability which I like: I can now create a 'superframe' folder in my facebook account and direct portal to display only those photos in round robin fashion. So now I have control of what gets seen and when. I put a small number of photos into that folder and change the photos periodically. I am still hopeful the other 2 capabilities will show up in the near future (remote administration, auto answer). I got portal plus about 9 months ago. It is great as a video chat device. The main benefit I saw is that display is large and the speakers are loud and voice control is available. This is used for the grandparents who are computer illiterate and somewhat hard of hearing. The speakers are loud so they can really hear me . It's volume is adjustable too for those not so deaf. This loudness was definitely required. When they video chat with me I can hear them fine too so the microphone is sensitive. This means whether they stand up close of talk from the kitchen (30 ft away). The display is larger that a tablet and we put it in landscape mode (can be portrait too) . Our goal is it is a device that just sits there and needs no attention like a landline telephone. It will take multiple calls at once ie video conference so the most we've had is 3 people call at once. All 3 were displayed simultaneously. The other thing that helps illiteracy is they can just answer by saying "" hey portal answer"". We did not want them to touch the device or initiate call. 'superframe' is what they call the display of pictures when not in a call. So we load it with tons of pictures and somehow it cycles and displays pictures. Not just what I load up but what I also put in their facebook account. I'm unclear as to when and what pictures get displayed. Easy to answer if you have just a few photos but if you have hundreds+ then I don't know which ones get chosen over time. So every week or so I add photos to their facebook account and hope newer ones show up. Lots of other capabilities but it accomplished our main objectives. Some features that I hope will come in future: 1) remote administration - so I can program /adjust as needed 2) auto answer - so I can check up on them and they don't have to do anything to answer 3) superframe - better control of what and when pictures show up. Click HELPFUL if you find this of benefit .","","loud and big picture","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6F54R2BCN5AB3H7EUGF3CCXNFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39F8BECMJ282O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It's a stunning piece of tech and impeccably made. The screen is huge and rotates effortlessly. The whole thing is rock solid and feels like something Apple would make. It's worth noting that it's quite large, which is great on one level but it takes up quite a bit of space for a device with pretty limited features (at least for now). The web-cam is a cool approach. It uses a 180 deg fisheye lens and then the software tracks your movement to follow you. That way you're free to move around while you chat and the software keeps you in frame all the time. This feature works pretty well with one person but it seemed to get confused on who to follow when my wife and I were in the frame together. I couldn't find a way to override this feature but, again, it's just software so there's no reason to think they won't refine it over time. As a digital picture frame, it also performs quite well. You can point it at any Facebook albums and it'll rotate through the photos. The one big weakness of this device in a household is that you have to lock it into one Facebook profile. So the ability to have multiple users in the house is not currently practical. That sucks on a few levels - at least in our house. It seems like something they could address though.","","Well built tech","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKF43DETPD37YLUDH7TXVNV7QFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHNCDPN8GYXG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It has a stand so it'll stand up wide ways or long ways. Now for the cons: Within a handful of quick uses every site stopped working. The only thing left working is Amazon. If I'm streaming in Amazon I only get so far before it stops with an error message.

I'll still have to use my echo for calls too, but I guess that's all right. Another good point is I like Portal as a digital photo frame when it's idle.

Our children were still small and we wanted to try our best to form a continued connection between them and our families, despite the distance. We tried skype and facetime on our phones, computers, and tablets, but found that the children either interrupted the communication by covering the entire camera or making faces at it, to watch themselves on the small screen, or ran away with the phone entirely wanting to communicate but ending up showing our parents a very uninteresting view of the ceiling. We were sad and frustrated and so were our parents, but we figured it was developmental and that our children would grow out of it. Then a friend told me about Portal tv and how it had completely changed video calling with her child and parents. We were hopeful, but skeptical when we ordered it, as it just may have been a difference between her child and ours lol. However, she was correct! Portal not only puts the picture on the television, but the camera can mount high meaning that the children cannot cover the entire screen! It is super simple to install and setup and makes video calling effortless. It pans in and out to follow movement and allows the person on the other end of the call to see and hear everyone equally! It has vastly improved our calls and makes us feel like our parents are right in the room! I‚Äôd recommend this to everyone!","","Game changer for video calls with kids","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKNBYHCYQMFWLXTRTAQROUNL34Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSP946QCG06H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

So I signed up a Facebook account for my Father for this purpose, putting in his real name and photo. After setting everything up, including adding friends and family to his list of contacts to call, Facebook locked his account, citing suspicious activity. Facebook requested another photo to unlock his account but after submitting this photo his account remains locked. So sitting in his living room is this expensive brick.

My phone has video calling/chatting/Face timing and so does my tablet. My computer has a webcam so I can/have used Skype and other video apps/sites before. But when I got this Portal and was setting it up I realized that I could call anyone through Facebook if they have one too or not. So anyone that has a Facebook with a connected phone number you can call them! It's fun and easy to use if you use the video chat feature or just treat it like a phone. The video quality is really great and the camera follows you/them as you move which is nice in case you're doing something like cleaning, cooking, or getting ready for example. It's a good size screen being 10 inches and the sound quality is great too. I like using Youtube through it as well. It has a really nice touch screen that responds just as well if not better than my phone and tablet. Oh and it has Alexa as a voice assistant built right in! So I can say ""Call Mike Jones or pull up Youtube"" and it'll do as instruction. Basically, the Facebook Portal has multiple uses and is really high quality! I can definitely say that I'm surprised yet glad to be able to honestly recommend it! I think it would make a fantastic and fun gift idea as well with the Holidays coming up. It's great to get in-touch with the ones you love and care about family, friends, or otherwise. :)","","A lot nicer and more useful than I originally thought it'd be!","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNPYY4BJWVNWKY2QVO5M73X4PEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSWSQXMMNP2XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It is amazing to video call friends and family with this device. - The discount on bundle of 2 is great deal since you can give one to your family and use the glorious way to video chat. - Physical buttons to cover the camera and mute the microphone resolves concerns with privacy. Cons: - Facebook's track record might not appeal to others. I didn't care much about it with the physical buttons to disable camera and microphone. - Uses an HDMI port on your TV so if you are using a TV with fewer HDMI ports, you wouldn't want to spare one just for video chat. - On my LG OLED TV since the screen is so thin, I cant put it on top and need to place below my TV on top of my soundbar which I hate.","","Portal TV: Best Video Calling Device","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPDTMKD4VSGAOCAM362BCTP3ILA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=82&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVCGBVXGCOUEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Now mind you, he didn't think much of Alexa before this, and couldn't understand why I had bought 6 more dots. I had our son, who is serving a mission for our church away from home, call us on messanger. HUBBY GONE WILD! He adores it!!! We conference with kids, (we have 9), and grandkids, (18 of them spread out everywhere). We can literally be there with them and read a book, say prayers, watch a game, etc., with the Portal. He called everyone he knew on it, just to tell them how cool it was and to show them the zoom and pan features it has. He struts around the kitchen while we make dinner, do dishes, eat breakfast and so on. Then I showed him what Alexa can do, and started a playlist for him on Spotify. He has 1010 songs! In 2 weeks! He has demanded a dot be put in his office and the garage, even by the pool. Don't think about it, just buy it! The Plus is worth the extra money.

HOWEVER, after the sale it was revealed by Facebook support that it DOES NOT work with Messenger Kids, which Facebook advertises as a modified Messenger account type. The above limitation of the Portal isn't listed in any advertising or sales materials. The most troublesome is that Facebook support is refusing to take any corrective action to remedy the situation, either under existing warranty or otherwise. Clear cut instance of deceptive advertising bait and switch tactic. Unless anything changes, I'd stay as far away from this product as possible.

I can make calls directly from it over WhatsApp or Facebook messenger. The camera quality is amazing, there is no lag in video/audio. The one thing I missed is that while the camera follows you around the room if my one-year old walks up close to the screen, as kids will do when they see people on the screen, the camera can't see her any more. If you were buying it for your kids to be able to talk to their grand-parents etc, don't buy this unless your kids are old enough to understand that they can't step up to the camera.

I might argue that the base model portal would be better with kids as it would be easier to move around to different rooms. That said when walking around the room that it is in it does an amazing job following you and widening to pick up other people who come in. The movement is butter smooth almost like there is a professional cameraman behind the scenes. Every once in a while you may have to move around a little for it to pick up on you being there and include you in the frame but that is more the exception than the rule. The video, sound and voice pickup quality are all top notch too. Something we noticed is that while you can share the augmented reality masks and faces the storytime function is limited by only allowing a portal device to be the one reading the story. When you're the one with kids and the portal it doesn't do any good. It's nice that you can make calls entirely by voice though the confirmation question every time is a little annoying. It could be useful to avoid accidental dials but from what I've seen the microphone and software works so well it isn't needed. You can also have more than one Facebook profile which is a must have for multiple sets of friends in a household and if for nothing else than allowing my wife to call me or me to call her depending on who's away. First and foremost it is a video chat device and while it is almost flawless there the secondary uses and their limitation are at sometimes annoying and infuriating at others. Want to listen to pandora? Sure you can start it with your voice but to choose a station you have to walk over and touch it anyway. Surely you can view a recipe on this thing right? Nope, not even a web browser to speak of. Display photos of your family? You better have them all in an album on Facebook because that is the only place you can use for the photo frame. Maybe we're not most people but that isn't how we use Facebook. It's a lot of one-off pictures that no one wants to see every day in a photo frame. Then there's Alexa. We use her heavily in our house for communicating across the house and performing various smart home tasks. Keeping the portal in the kitchen seems like a good way to have an all in one device. The limitations here are mind blowing. First, the microphone on this is so sensitive that it picks up ""Alexa"" from other rooms and unlike an actual Echo doesn't realize you're closer to another one. It takes over which ruins room grouping and sometimes it just can't do things like ""drop in"". Then you've got a giant screen so you'd think it would work like an Echo show and allow you to for instance view a security camera. Nope, can't do that either. If I ask it to play music from my Plex server it says ok and then never plays any audio. The 3rd party integration leave a ton to be desired and in my opinion aren't ready. There just isn't enough there and it feels incomplete. I've been conflicted when giving this a rating. On one hard it's main function is to make great video calls and it does that. On the other, it advertises a bunch of functionality that feels half baked. For a device this size it should be an all-in-one and I would be willing to bet a lot of people will buy one assuming it can do that. The problem is that it can't and it's disappointing when trying to do these other things. It needs more photo sources, more apps, and more functionality for the ones it has. It is on software version 1.0.0 so hopefully there will be a lot of additions when there is finally an update.","","VIdeo calls are great but the other parts are just annoying in their limitations","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMGLNAYIQXYCL5QC222GDNFOQMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=99&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2URKKSW146MSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

There is not a lot of storage, and it is not meant for heavy app usage outside of what is provided. That being said: for that it is the FB Portal Plus is a blast. The video quality in calls is great, and everyone we have chatted with so far days our video feed is stellar. The video tracking feature is fun as well, but ultimately not that important to the video chatting experience. We use the Alexa feature heavily in our house, and also use the Facebook photos feature to rotate through pictures as a rotating background wallpaper. Also: The hands free feature to start and end calls is nice. It's very apparent that Portal has a very limited command vocabulary compared to, say, Alexa which understands tons of commands. I assume in future iterations these commands will be broadened and made more intuitive.

I pretty much screwed in the bar that holds it up as well as the power source. You then turn the Portal on and follow the steps. I utilized my Facebook app to set it up. It does take a couple minutes to download Portal software to the device, which I thought was weird. I would have assumed the device would already come with the software it needs to work. Use: Using Portal to make video calls is easy. Once you're logged in, you can make video calls to other people who have Facebook Messenger installed on their phones. We used it to call my mother in law and my sister in law. I found this was an easy way to do video calling and my toddler seems to enjoy it too. The camera is one of those smart ones, so basically it stays focused on you as you move around. I liked that this can be all hands free. Using Alexa works well on this device too. You just give it voice commands and it works. Unfortunately, we have the portal set up next to an Echo dot which can get annoying. I'd recommend not putting them next to each other. Also, name your Portal something different than the room it is in. For us, when we say turn the living room off, it not only turns off our lights, but also the portal. The super frame is a cool feature, where it works as a digital photo frame. However, it really shows like the same six photos for fifteen seconds each. To make a change, it makes you log into your facebook account. I don't like constantly logging into my account on my phone to make changes when I am already logged in on the device. You can have a couple different FB accounts logged into Portal. As for privacy, there's a switch that can turn off the camera. You also determine which information saves and which does not. Probably the most annoying thing about Portal, as a person with a toddler who keeps this device at a level he can reach, is that to set a passcode on the device so he doesn't randomly call someone from college that I haven't spoken with in ten years, you need to log into your FB app first and can't just do it from Portal. I think that's a really annoying and flawed piece of functioning. This is a really neat device when it comes to video calling and I like that it is loud when playing my music via Alexa. However, a lot of what this device does can also be done via a tablet or iPad.","","A Neat Device - But Other Devices Can Do The Same Thing Easier","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQEYMI73265BW7NR6WCGPJM26UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R107SR1ZLXSLUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I tried out a different video frame before for my 95 year old dad, but it was a bit to complicated for him to use. I thought I'd give the Facebook portal a try and it has worked out better than I could have imagined. I love it so much I bought a second one for myself. My dad lives in another state in an assisted living facility. With the pandemic they aren't allowing visitors. I'm not sure when I'll be able to visit him next, but the portal is like a virtual visit. He can be almost anywhere in the main room of his apartment and it will follow him around. It really feels like I'm in the room with him. It really is amazing. My dad isn't technical, but with the portal he doesn't have to be. He uses the Alexa commands to call people and answer a call. Before I sent it to him I created a facebook account for him and added all of my brothers and sisters. All he had to do is connect it to his wifi. The only thing I wish they would improve, the voice assistant doesn't respond if you don't have wifi. It would be nice if it would response enough to let you set up wifi. It also doesn't have voice commands to dim the screen. My brother was a bit hesitant to use it because he's not a fan of video chat programs like Zoom or Facetime. He's rather just talk on the phone. After trying it he's a believer. It has a completely different feel than other video chat programs. Instead of someone's face on your screen it feels like you're in the room with the person you're talking to. I bought one for myself so I could set it in a desk and ""hang out"" with my dad. we talk and play games.","","Bought for my dad and love it!","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVCOZDL5LVU6OCA2UF2LNMPIE2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSNBMO8Y36W5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Basically it's a very expensive, big video telephone for making calls to other people who also own a Facebook portal, with very little other useful features. You can also use it as an extremely large, very expensive electric picture frame, to cycle through your Facebook photos. I was initially excited by the whole thing: it's very very big, so if you want a really big tablet mounted on what amounts to a not very good Amazon Alexa-like device, there's that. In the setup process they demonstrate what I think is a pretty cool feature: the built-in camera kind of follows you around the room - kind of neat example of AI technology, I think. Here's what I find so disappointing: the most obvious use for this thing, I think, would be to ""go live"" on Facebook, basically video blogging, but incredibly, you can't do that. As far as I can tell you really can only use this thing to contact other people who have Facebook portal devices. There are lots of other ways to do video chatting but if you have money to burn, and two people who would like to frequently do video chats, you might enjoy these portals. Another nice feature: the packaging is really top-notch. Outstanding. That's important in a product so useless, because you'll want to return it within 30 minutes of setting it up.","","Not ready for primetime","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWLYUVEBNJZD5ZLMXEWYO6M4BTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39AIMGKOWOSDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Don't even question it, just get it. For anything beyond that, the software is far too immature. Seems like a beta product. I use two of them to talk between my two offices in two different physical locations. There is no ""mute"" button on the device to mute the playing audio, so when I get a phone call or a customer walks in, I have to walk to the device and physically press the side buttons until the volume is down and then when I'm done, walk back to the device and physically keep tapping ""up"" until the audio is where I want it. I thought a solution would be to connect an Echo Dot (since it has a physical mute button"" and the Portal connects to it, and identifies it as a bluetooth headset, but won't send audio to it! A couple quick software fixes would easily make this a 5-star product.

They were woefully inaccurate. Firstly, it does what it is designed to do superbly - that is make video calls. It is way more functional that most devices in that I can actually make international calls with no problems. I just held a chat with my niece in England. The video was not perfect as she was on a cell phone but it was smooth and only slightly fuzzy. With a laptop or better still anther portal, the video is excellent. The fact that you do not have to have a portal at both ends makes it way more functional than devices like the Amazon Echo Show. Add to that the artificial intelligence that is built in to track and frame the caller which is just amazing. I can move around the room and I am free to do whater I want without worrying if I am wandering out of frame. The Portal is competitively priced compared to the Echo Show and the Protal+ is well worth the extra to get the larger screen which makes video calling seem like you are almost in the same room. It also makes adjustments for the ambient light in the room. The sound quality is excellent. While it lacks some functionality, it does have Amazon's Alexa built in. For someone like myself with Echo's around the house, it means I do not have to learn a whole new set of commands for things I am already used to doing. Some writers criticized the fact that you need to use ""Hey Portal...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."" for Facebook functionality (primarily making calls) to ""Alexa...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."" for Amazon functions but it really is not that difficult to handle. In terms of what it can and cannot do, there are really few limits. It will turn on and off my Alexa devices and control the thermostat. It has a built in web browser so that, for instance, you can go to YouTube and play videos. So far, I am delighted with the device. some critics have panned Facebook for it's security record but it collects no more from the portal than it does when you use facebook on your phone or laptop. Facebook promises additional features and improvements in the near future. I'll look forward to added features but even without them, I am happy with the unit which does exactly what it was designed for and so much more.","","Underestimated by most reviews.","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHIJX3777O52K6QMAQK6GIT6JW6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=93&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UANMZ18E2QHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Since I live out-of-'town from my family, and travel is not an option during the pandemic, I wanted a way to feel close and stay in contact. I've tried video calls on iPhone, IPad pro (12.9""), computers, and the smaller Portal. They work, but all have their problems. Most issues for me relate to sound quality. Either I can't hear the other people due to my speakers not reproducing voices clearly (or I have to put on headphones but then no one else in the room can hear the conversation), they can't hear me due to my mic or my position to the mic, or the software cuts people off while it negotiates audio input and output at the same time. The smaller screens of phones and tablets are also unpleasant for a call more than a few minutes long. This thing solves those problems. I've also tried the smaller Portal and it was ok, but really not much better than a tablet. The camera tracking was nice, but the audio quality wasn't great and I felt like the screen was too small...which detracts from the experience of mimicking a real visit. The only downside to me is you're locked into the Facebook ecosystem, so as far as I know you can't use it with other services. I'm kind of surprised no competitors have produces something comparable yet. But if you can't visit friends or family and want to keep in contact with them, it's worth it for both parties to get one of these. Two of these would be about the same price as one plane ticket, that you can use it over and over, without catching Covid.","","Beats video calls on phones, tablets computers, and the smaller Portal","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPFYY4FGC73EKOKUC7YEKHICANA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO15NIJLSUD2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Smart, Hands-Free Video Calling with Alexa Built-in. This is basically a tablet screen hooked permanently to a stand containing a speaker, microphone and camera. The picture, video and audio quality is excellent. Set-up was easy. The price however is too high (should never retail for more than $249). My main complaint is the lack of apps. Mine came with Facebook Watch, YouTube, Newsy, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio, Food Network. No Netflix, Hulu Plus, Skype, Nord VPN, Vudu, Amazon Music or Amazon Ptime Movies to mention a few. Skype is important because with Skype you cannot only video conference with other Skype members, but you can make non-video calls to any phone using your Skype credit. Makes no difference whether the person has a Facebook or Messenger account at all. Nord VPN is critical to protect your records and calls from Facebook and future data breaches at Facebook. The product description says ""Facebook doesn't listen to, view or keep the contents of your Portal video calls. Calls on Portal are encrypted, so conversations stay between you and those you're calling."" Given Facebook's scandals and data breaches however these statements should not be trusted or believed. And note the key word ""contents."" You should assume Facebook will keep records of who you video conference with and when, and that while calls are claimed to be encrypted, they are likely not encrypted against Facebook. An app for Nord VPN would cure that, as Nord VPN has military grade encryption and is not located in the USA, making it not subject to court orders from the USA, etc. I give 3 of 5 stars. Picture, video and audio quality is excellent. Set-up is easy. Lack of enough apps, especially Skype and Nord VPN, is a strong negative. Comparing the Portal Plus from Facebook, the Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show (2nd Generation), the Amazon Echo Show appears to be the better product with better value for now.","","Not worth the money and inferior to the Amazon Echo Show - 2nd","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF43ICLBXTCEJQ5VYEXTTRE4PPHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SEYT306SL3ET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I hadn't done any research on it and overall, for the price I'd say I'm really disappointed. If you video chat with family members all the time, this is probably a worthwhile investment. Otherwise, wait til they've worked out all the bugs - my feeling is they rushed to get this out for the holiday season when they should have waited and gotten it right. My primary complaint is that it doesn't work great as an Alexa - 20% of the time it just doesn't even respond when I'm standing right there. Sometimes when I play music it will just stop during the middle of a song and still display the album, like it freezes in its Amazon Music capability. Also recently I've set timers that just never go off - I bake a lot, so this is frustrating. I'll get suspicious and be like, ""Alexa, how much time is left on my timer?"" and it'll say ""your timer is currently being delivered"" but there is literally no other sound coming out of the portal. Now I just walk into the other room and set timers on our regular Echo. I'm ready to swap them back out because the Echo is way more reliable. Again, the video calls are cool, and the video/sound quality is great, and we made a ton in the first couple of weeks, but most of our family is local so they newness wore off pretty quickly, and I'm left being so disappointed and feeling like we paid way too much.","","Wait and buy the second generation","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJX2N3KDSXSDEUDYFP73L6COSIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVPH8QZ7MEBRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It does a very good job when it comes to a couple of key features. It is NOT however replace a smartphone or tablet when it comes to many of the advertised ""extra"" features. The two tasks that this device excels at is acting as a communications platform for hands-free videoconferencing and acting as an alarm clock/radio. The former uses the Facebook Messenger platform. You can either use voice prompts directly with the device or activate the Amazon Alexa plug-in which gives you some additional voice commands. The videoconferencing feature works extremely well, but obviously only works if the person you are calling is ready and willing to do a video chat with you. The vast majority of people using Messenger only use it for texting or audio calls, so you really have to know someone else using the same platform for video calls for it to be worthwhile. the alarm clock/radio feature is pretty simplistic, but works. The radio basically makes use of the Pandora of Spotify streaming services. There is no option to load your own music via an SD card or choose a different streaming platform. That brings us to the other features of the product, which are basically just a limited number of apps similar to that you can find on an Android device. Most of these apps just let you access specific parts of Facebook or tune-in to a limited number of mass media platforms. By far, the single most useful app that you can download is ""Browser"", which is a fairly functional web browser that seems to be based on the Android version of Chrome. Using the browser app I was able to login to Amazon and stream movies from their Prime Video collection with no problems. Streaming was flawless and the included speaker made movies easy to hear from across the room. Unfortunately, the audio system does not seem to include an Automatic Gain Control, which makes listening to movies particularly frustrating. The sound will go from being barely audible to far too loud for comfort from one second to another. The device obviously was not designed with multimedia in mind. I do not believe that the audio is even in stereo as it comes from a single speaker. The rest of the apps are pretty much useless. One thing very much worth mentioning here is the lack of ability to easily control the audio unless you are actually standing in front of the device using the touch screen. While you can use Alexa to command the device to increase or decrease volume, it does not do so in increments that are at all practical. The best method of solving this problem would be to include a small remote control. So far, this option does not seem to be available though. I own a number of Android tablets and phones, which begs the question... Why would anyone pay $179 for this device instead of just buying a cheap Android tablet instead? If you are familiar with operating an Android device there really is no reason to choose this product over an Android tablet on which you can already install Messenger, Alexa and many hundreds of more apps. I think that the main market for this device is largely the very old and very young who are not are not very technology savvy. There are quite a few versions of the Amazon Kindle that are less expensive and will do a WHOLE lot more than just act as an oversized alarm clock with messaging features. If you're looking for a way to easily hook your grandparents up to the Internet this might be a good choice given it's extremely simple design. For those of us who have plenty of experience with tablets and smartphones I really can't see any reason to run out and buy this product though.","","Decent Device For Technophobes","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1NBD4TESW7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Let me tell you, it is a game changer. She hasn't set up her own Facebook account yet so I set her up on my account for now. Even though she isn't tech savvy she knows exactly how to work this. It's very simple and easy to use. It also acts as a digital frame so she can see pictures, listen to music and even play games. The sound quality is really great even when she's in the kitchen cooking with her back turned, we can still hear her. This makes a fantastic gift for anyone that you can't see in person all the time and want to keep in touch with them.

So I wanted to demo this myself before recommending it to my clients. I had ours installed within 5 minutes and on our first video chat. Our Portal is connected through the HDMI input of a Denon AVR and the video is shown on a new 75"" Sony UHD-TV. We have had a few calls that were pixelated or where the calls were dropped, however I believe that was most likely a reception issue originating from the person(s) we called. Both parties we called live in rural areas or areas that have poor cellular and Ethernet reception. I am quite pleased with the video quality when WiFi strength is good and how effectively the camera adjusts to Zoom and Pan thus accommodating people moving about in the room. If I make a Portal call from my couch the camera zooms onto me and any movements. If my wife enters the room the camera immediately zooms out to get her into frame until she sits next to me on the couch, then the camera zooms in closer to include us both in the video call. Using a Sony Smart TV and enabling HDMI-CEC I can be watching Netflix from the Sony Netflix app and all I have to say is ""Hey Portal Call Mom"" The Portal responds and begins the call. Once the call begins the Sony TV automatically switches from Netflix to Portal TV. This is perfect for the older generation who are not technically savy. A great way to stay in touch with kids, parents, grandparents and friends afar. We have used the Story Telling feature with our 2 year old grandson who loved the interaction with us. Only Con I have is that it has no hardwired Ethernet connection, only Wi-Fi. When we first installed Portal TV we had Xfinity 300mbps Wi-Fi, last week we upgraded to Google Fiber Gigabit so I again I am certain that any video issues we are experiencing are actually originating from whom we called. It may be they do not have their mobile device camera set at the highest resolution, poor celluar and or Wi Fi reception. I have not tried any of the included streaming apps on the PortalTV as we use the apps from our Sony UHD TV. For the price this a wonderful device, for my many deaf and hearing impaired friends this is AWESOME, as it does have a hand held remote so speaking commands is not necessary.","","Easy set up, great features; perfect for the Deaf and Hearing impaired..","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSOY5HCDD6C6FWV6XLYII3MO7MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DRBIVJ2R6NRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I was disappointed to discover that the Portal TV as compared to the other portal devices do not support Zoom. This was not obvious from the Amazon website. If you are trying to have a video chat with someone who does not have WhatsApp or an Apple device, you are out of luck. So far, I have not found anyone who is willing to download Whatsapp so that I can use my portal tv for a video chat! Since Zoom is the most frequently used app for group meetings, this is a major disadvantage. I did email Portal support to ask them when if ever Portal Tv will be able to support Zoom and the answer was that they didn't know. If they don't know, I assume the answer is probably never, though perhaps one day I will be happily surprised.

Over the years we've tried video calling from smartphones, laptops, iPads, Echo Shows.. you name it. This Christmas I went all-in and bought 3 Portals and NOTHING has been as fun or as easy as these... we love them! - I bought one for the grandparents - PERFECT grandparent gift. Walk up, tap a photo, and you're calling.. the UX is very simple. It's the first device that has been simple enough that my grandparents feel empowered to initiate video calls. - I bought one for my sister with young kids - they LOVE story mode and also all of the built-in effects/costumes. Picture quality seems way clearer than what we used to use (Facebook Messenger on iOS).. and selfishly I love being able to see my nieces and nephews so much more clearly. - I bought one for my parents.. they love it. Finally they can both fit in the screen, unlike when they were always trying to awkwardly hold their iPhones in selfie mode before. I am not affiliated with Facebook in any way, and I'll admit, I wish some other company had invented this product. But this whole thing works so well for my family because it's built on top of Facebook Messenger (which is what we already used to message each other)... and it means we can answer video calls on our phones, laptops, etc. if we're not at home and near the Portal. Small things I wish were better: - It has Alexa but doesn't work with the Ring doorbells - The photo slideshow mode is ok, but didn't surface a lot of gems (personally I wish it drew from Google Photos) - The first day she got it, my nephew went wild and called all of my sisters facebook friends.. she wishes there was a way to ""lock it down"" to family only - My grandparents often can't hear their portal ringing in a multi-room house (once I had to call their phone to tell them to pick up on their Portal)","","My family absolutely loves this product","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AER2PX3A7NNGJMM4YQC65V742FLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=96&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCB2CGYS0257Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I wanted him to be able to video chat with the family when we weren't able to visit him. Unfortunately, his retirement community went on lockdown before I could deliver it. So until I can get it to him, we are using it in our home. I have a 5year old and a 16 month old. Video chatting with them via phone is hard for the people on the other end of the screen. They are ALL OVER THE PLACE and hard to follow. The portal has a nice wide field of vision that keeps them in frame most of the time However the BEST feature is the automatic face detection and camera tracking. It follows the girls all over our living room, keeping them in frame so their grandparents can always see them. It isn't 100% perfect, but it is a huge improvement over not having ng this feature and just trying to follow them with the phone. Surprised - I thought this was a pointless product, but now that I have one, it is the only way I want to video call Fwiw, the Alexa and FB assistant I tegratio s are nice, and the speakers are quite good quality (and powerful).

I'm not nearly as anxious about the thought of another Covid spike in our state, and her assisted living having to shut down visitors again, because I know I'll still be able to ""see"" her and her apartment, and observe first-hand that all is well for her.

Repeatedly. The Portal+ was nice because it has Zoom, but Zoom required a fair amount of manual work for every call, and for an elderly person, it was too much. It has a USB C port, which with an HDMI adapter, we hooked it up to a big screen TV for her. Without the adapter, it worked so-so - there were occasional connection issues and whatnot. With the adapter, it worked worse - more connection issues, HDMI-CEC rarely worked (not never, which would've been more acceptable, but rarely which was frustrating knowing it could/should work), green lines on the TV, the TV turning on and off by itself, etc. So we returned it and tried the Portal TV thinking that its sole purpose is to hook up to the TV. Mistake. We tried so many combinations of so many things and we just gave up after a while and returned this one, too. We re-purchased the original touchscreen version with the knowledge that it has big drawbacks, and hoped we just had a couple flukey models. When it works, my mom thoroughly enjoys video calls with her kids all over the country. Instead of working as one would expect (through voice commands dialing any of us using WhatsApp), one of the kids that lives close to her has to drive over more often than not when the device doesn't work and get it going through some random trial and error. Wildly inconvenient, but for her enjoyment... And their tech support... what a joke. I spent a couple months with them - I'd share the issue with the specs of her TV, and they'd reply days later asking what the issue is or what the TV specs are. I'd reply again and not hear back for over a week until after I emailed them again. I'd tell them it works flawlessly only one time right after a factory reset, so they suggest I factory reset it to see if it solves the problem. They'd reply asking for information they already asked for, and at times describing a solve for an issue I never had. And again disappearing for a week until I emailed them again. They asked me to restart the router, which I told them is the retirement complex's router and I don't have access, so they described to me what a router is.","","Good idea, needs a lot of work, and Horrible tech support","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJIAMP6L2UFAG4AMFRPYVEAQ2PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SVINWQKRAHU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Setup was a breeze when linking it to my Facebook account, Alexa integration is great, I love that it acts as a picture frame displaying the latest pics from my Facebook uploads and the video calling via Facebook Messenger is smooth (especially with the camera that pans and zooms as you walk around the room). The filters are also fun and easier to use than on your smartphone! The biggest awkward spot that I found is that I set it up with my account, but my kids are the ones using it most and they've sent goofy video messages to co-workers from my account! There are several other services (Spotify, Pandora, etc.) supported, but I find myself using other devices for those. Overall, the Portal is great, though! As a picture frame and video caller using Facebook Messenger, it can't be beat!

I was hoping the issue I had with the initial product would be corrected in the coming months but it seems nothing has changed. Pro: Good picture quality Easy setup Cons:. The pan/zoom feature is obnoxious. The AI randomly pans and zooms on occasion when I am not even moving. Either improve the technology or at the very least, give an option to disable it. Connectivity to Facebook messenger is sloppy. Yes, you can search for your contacts and do group video chats but you can't look up or favorite your current Facebook messenger groups to do a video chat. You have to add people to the video call one by one and sometimes finding them via the search function is a challenge. You also cannot save that new group with a unique name for future calls. This seems to be a basic function for a product partnered with Facebook and really needs to be fixed. Pls fix the software and roll out an update. This could be an amazing product with some simple fixes. EDIT: reduced my rating to one star. I would return this if I could. No updates! Still randomly pans and zooms. Difficult to connect to your Facebook groups and the connection drops frequently. I'm back to using my laptop and web cam. I'm so disappointed.

While it's been fun to talk to individuals, the person on the other end of the call hasn't like the experience hardly at all. I've been debating returning it since the first day I used because of this reason. My other major complaint is that you're unable to do group calling with it. I have different family groups set up in WhatsAPP. Sadly, it doesn't recognize any of these groups. They advertised it as a way to hold family functions over the holidays without being ""together""-- I guess this holds true if it's just you talking to one other family member. The Facebook Messenger side of it, is a bit of a lame duck too. And, it's most definitely not very easy to navigate and figure out. I'm hoping for a software update fixing these issues that I can download to my current Portal device.","","Really Bad echo + Delay + No Group Calling","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEX5TDQB3LNBTOFMBO2LQKC6DB7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RLYE03NS5PPF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The Portal plus is easy to set up and not over heavy and can thus be moved from location to location easily, however it does require a WiFi connection and an outlet in order to function. The Facebook Portal Plus has some incredibly amazing technology built in but has not developed enough apps or relationships with outside companies to be as indespensible as it could be one day. For now, the Portal Plus is a realllly cool toy. The camera is high quality and shows incredible imaging. It‚Äôs smart features and ability to follow you while moving around the room is mind blowing. Truly. You can video chat with anyone who has Facebook messenger and is a contact or with another portal user. It does have a very small group of apps that you can download for use with the portal such as YouTube, newsy, iHeartRadio, pandora, Spotify, food network and Facebook (obvi). You can have it show your FB photos but they display ina. Random, nonsensical order. You can watch videos or use it to listen to music IF you have a subscription to the services available but you can not use it to connect to your phone‚Äôs library or playlists as you can with Alexa. The Portal plus responds to verbal commands well but I have found the touchscreen to be supersensitive and thus I am not always able to access what I am looking for. The video and audio quality is excellent and it does connect up with your Alexa does you can use it to respond to questions Or directions asked of Amazon Alexa but not with other amazon services such as prime video or music. Odd. Overall the Portal Plus has A LOT of amazing potential but just is not there yet. IF you are a fan of being an early adopter than this will certainly be an amazing holiday gift however I am hoping that Facebook is looking for feedback and will add the ability to connect to your iPhone to play videos, music or slide shows as well as adding additional apps that can truly take advantage of the incredible technology built into the portal","","A lot of potential but just has not reached its optimal uses as of yet","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGX43O5SACIAFABB3W4NLSCLKUZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=99&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F9H3T3UOW4NZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I'm very tech savvy. I have parents who live in a rural area, and so video calling with them is one way we stay close - so that's very important to me. However, it blows my mind in today's day and age that video calling on TVs is not more widespread. Calling on a phone or tablet is fine, but when it comes to wanting to see 2+ people at the same time - those just don't cut it. I looked at several different ways to setup video calling for my parents on a larger screen with a wide angle camera - and Facebook Portal TV was literally the ONLY reasonable option. The next closest was hooking up a laptop and a webcam to a TV, but that is tedious and cumbersome to do frequently. Portal TV fills this product gap, and does so admirably. I read just about every review from the ""tech experts"" - and almost all of them did not recommend this product simply because it came from Facebook. What a joke. This is an AWESOME product. Those ""experts"" all judged this product based on name alone, and did their readers a disservice. As someone who could work for Facebook and knows about software, this product appears very safe. The calling is encrypted. You can turn off sending Alexa voice data. The camera tracking software operates locally only. And there are two very easy to use hardware switches to turn off the microphone and video. And you can set pin access to the interface. If you can trust Facebook with a Facebook account, you can trust them with this product. It looks very safe to me if someone just reads the simple instructions. As far as how the product works - I'm only using it for video calling. I do Portal TV to Portal TV with my family. My family has pretty slow internet, and the Portal TV even handled that pretty well. They could always hear and see me pretty well (I have 100 Mbps) and maybe 5% of the time I got fuzzy video or loss of audio and video on their connection (probably 6ish Mbps). That's great. Most things don't do well on my parents internet - and this survived. The camera tracking and panning is excellent - I have seen no issues and played around with it alot. It has comfortably handled 2-4 people walking in and out of the frame. I'm a huge fan. This is an excellent product, and I've recommended it to several people - especially in those covid time. It's not cheap - but I think it's worth it. For my family and I to be able to see each other clearly and comfortably on 50+ in screens is priceless. I'm not a Facebook fanboy. Facebook has totally dropped the ball on a LOT of things in recent years, and their business origins are definitely ""complicated"". However - I think they did a great job with this product. This is exactly how the experience should be. I'm a very happy Customer.","","Wonderful, and fills a huge product gap in tech","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBCBQ77FASMBQ4EGDKIQERA7DIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28BUBB3KNPLLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

"B07XPDYRRJ","Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black","4.6","1024","Naomi","","","Color: Black | Style: Portal Plus","B07HFWG8S4","https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/product-reviews/B07HFWG8S4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format","4.0","November 13, 2018","United States","For those who are debating an Alexa device with screen capabilities, whether you will like the Portal or not will depend on what you want to use it for. In taking the smart home plunge, I ended up purchasing 4 Echo Shows (2nd generation) and 2 Facebook Portal+‚Äôs for my home because I wanted both, PA & Drop in function, but also a primo video chat. Here‚Äôs why I have both: The Echo Show (2nd generation) exceeds the Portal + in overall functionality. It provides all of the features of the previous model and more. I wanted some (or all) of my primary devices to sometimes act as a PA & also be able to use the ‚ÄòDrop in‚Äô feature when I am not home. I live in a condo and have an 8wk old puppy coming. Though I work from home, at some point if I need to go on a run or leave for an hour or two, I am still able to access the camera and speak to her if she‚Äôs barking at the front door. For now, Facebook Portal does not have this feature. With the Echo Show there is also no need for an external hub for most of my smart devices because it‚Äôs built right in. I‚Äôm unsure if Portal has this. With the Show, there is also direct access to the internet. Just ask Alexa to play movie trailers, Prime videos, etc. The display is nice, but I would chalk up the video calling and ‚ÄòDrop in‚Äô quality to better than that of my security cameras (also high quality). The Facebook Portal+ display and AI camera technology far exceeds that of any other device I‚Äôve used. I purchased this for the calling feature - which is its‚Äô primary function. During a call, you no longer need to employ being your own camera man during the call - it‚Äôs completely hands-free and smoothly follows you around the room like a movie director. I was impressed by the range at which it accurately followed me and will even follow in the direction of your voice if you happen to step out of the frame. Very limited on other functions though and I expect more are soon to follow within the year once the ‚Äòdata breach‚Äô blah blah stuff calms down a bit. Though the Portal does not support the PA & ‚ÄòDrop in‚Äô functions that the Echo Show has, I can still control all of my smart home devices & groups with ease and employ all of my routines with no problem. If you‚Äôre looking for all-around functionality and more features the Echo Show (2nd) is the way to go. If quality video calling is the priority, then you can‚Äôt beat the Portal+ for now - it far exceeds everything else in that arena.","","Portal+ or Echo Show (2nd) - Good start with hopefully more features coming","285","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHS5NPPYL7O2T37O4IV76CXHHFNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=101&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XGVBPTMJ7IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Initial setup was very easy, linking both Facebook and Alexa accounts. The integration for validation was fast and easy. First and foremost, this is a portal - which is generally defined as a door or gate or entry. That's what this is at the end of the day. The Alexa integration is nice, but seems rather singular, maybe others will come later. However, it's definitely a FB Messenger-centric device. It's a pretty large piece of hardware, well packaged and nicely constructed. The screen rotation is super-easy. The first problem was, ""where does it go""? As large as it is, it makes one think of an office. Given its ability to work with Alexa and some of the apps on it, we decided the kitchen would be a good place to go - at the edge of a counter where it can stand full height that it is - 18 inches. I am a new user to FB video messaging, so my first focus was making this part of the Alexa ecosystem in the house. The Alexa function is a little substandard - for instance, you can't change the wake word. There are other features that are missing - perhaps this is par for non-Amazon devices. Alexa does work, and there is potential for it to be a more valuable member of the Alexa family with more visual-centric things in the future. At one point, suddenly Alexa wasn't functioning and was acting like a lost network (behavior was the same as our other Echo devices when the network is down). However, network functionality was present on all else (including my other Echo devices). No amount of power cycling or switching networks got it working, and I ended up disconnecting Alexa from it and re-connecting it (which means you have to re-authorize it with Amazon). Not sure how Alexa can lose the ""connection"" (virtual) and not re-establish it. When Alexa is working, however, it's fine. I wish it was more like a full-up Echo device in terms of all features being supported. Tonight, with two timers set for cooking, it literally failed to deliver. Asking about how much time was left, Alexa responded with ""the timer is currently being delivered:"". In other words, it was stuck trying to say the timer was done. In fact, both timers had failed - the Alexa app reporting both as with 00:00 remaining. BAD NEWS for a device that you rely on. All of our Echo devices are flawless but the Portal's implementation is not good. Another annoying behavior - I could start listening to iHeart Radio via voice command, but could not make it stop. You can mute it, but not stop it via voice command. A simple ""Hey Portal, stop playing"" would be nice. I just feel that the portal is very limited - which I suppose is part of being a ""portal"", but what IS there should be fully voice-supported. Some of the extras, like Food Network, are very light on content. A thirty second view of doing some food item is not much more than showing an idea - this could be a super useful tool in the kitchen (which happens to be where we have it) with some enhancement. While the sound is plenty, it's a little boom-y at the bass end. Most people wouldn't notice it, but I use high-quality speakers with my Echo devices and this just doesn't measure up to those. But, it's completely adequate for messaging and does play decent sound for music. Where this shines is FB video messaging. It's fabulous for that. Our first test was with FB on a phone at the other end of the country, and aside from some small blips of audio interruption, it did great. We don't have fast internet provider and the Portal had no problem on this end. Cell service is iffy at the other end, but it did just find. I see more video glitches and dropouts on our expensive [famous commercial brands] video teleconferenceing than I see on the FB setup. I'm very impressed. I won't go on and on about the value of video, but it's really like being there. We can't see our grandkids as often as we'd like right now, but it's so cool to see them and hear them as they grow - and this totally shortens the interval that we can check in with, compared to transcontinental flight. Awesome. For being essentially a single-tasker, with the side functionality of Alexa, it does well at what it's really designed for, but is disappointing with its Alexa integration. Pricing is pretty steep for this unit, but there's a lot of screen to enjoy and the rotation is a cool feature. However, I think it has a LOT of potential but will be stuck as an only-Facebook device unless there is more development on that part of the function. These days, you need to be widely functional, not focused on just one thing (think smartphones here). But with some increased functionality additions this could really be a hit. As it stands, we want to get one of these (probably the smaller one) for our remote family so we can enjoy full functionality with both ends working the same. But you don't have to have two to enjoy FB messaging on this device, it's a huge step up from the phone-centric video communication with even one end using it.","","Fabulous at FB Messenger video, poor Alexa integration","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKQZPHDQPZZ3NCAQJBE6LKTKRRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CEG00A32QPF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The picture on the cell phone is so small that the toddler isnt interested in it for a long time. Portal TV seemed to solve all of these issues. The idea of just lounging on your sofa and seeing the other end in a huge 65 inch picture seemed great. The toddler will see grandma super well. The camera tracking would follow the child in case she is running around. What could be better? The Portal TV does deliver. On the video side. Its a major game changer. I would not go back to cell phone based video calling, unless I absolutely have to. The problem, rather surprisingly, is audio. Portal TV doesnt deliver a full duplex experience where both parties here each others all the time. For whatever reason, Portal TV missed syllables and even whole words.

Not a problem, until FB starts to flag it for fraud. While great Fraud detection in concept, not great when now trying to get multiple portal devices up and running with multiple accounts and tried to etup privacy tight. Of course we are setting these up for the Elderly, The whole point it to make video calls easy for them. 2) Once setup configuring the portal seemed easy...everything ok there. 3) After configured, the portals stopped receiving calls.. Calling out was fine. wouldn't receive. So I put my account on the portal...it received fine. Something wrong with the account permissions? Duplicated what I could see from my account to theirs... nope didn't work. Recreated one of the accounts... started working. Then about 10 mins later.. wouldn't receive calls again. At this point I have been trying things for 3 days. Googling, reading the help on Facebook portal. Nothing has flown across the room yet. 4) reached out to support and tried to explain everything on a chat window... not ideal. They gave me all the same advice as the website and google searches. Asked if there was phone support. Lots to get lost with chat. Nope no phone support. Since the problem is not obvious they aren't helpful and tried to send us back to the portal help page.

I can only send or cast photos, not videos. The apps it can use are less than Echo Show‚Äôs. Like the Show, you can‚Äôt stream Netflix but at least the Show can stream prime video. With the Portal you can‚Äôt stream anything. I also hate that the screen shuts off completely when not in use because I placed it where I want to see a clock. The echo show will go to a dark screen and show the time. The portal plus does not. It just goes completely black. What a waste of clock space. I am going to keep it for now because I like the slideshow effect. I uploaded a bunch of pics and for now I like having what I call a live picture frame of pics going from one to the next. So basically right now it‚Äôs a $250 photo frame. The portal plus can be improved immensely if they actually let you do things with the screen. Right now, there are only one or two things you can do. What a waste. I hate that I can‚Äôt even cast a video on it from my phone because even the Show lets you do that. It would have been better to be able to do so on this larger screen. Useless. EDIT 1: I just tried out a Whatsapp call. Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. The video quality was great. The other person can hear and see me fine.

Alexa is convenient, but not as functional as an echo device with no ability to drop in on other alexa devices, and limited smart home features, as I can't view my Nest cameras like I can on the Echo Show.

I love them both Let me start off by saying if you are not a Facebook user than this may not be the device for you. It's for voice and video chatting with family and friends on Facebook or WhatsApp. It has other apps like Facebook Watch and live. It has Zoom, Bluejeans, Work live and other work services that are not full services. You can't type in the chat. It has Alexa, but it's not a full version. It does not have drop in or call because that is an Amazon feature on the Echos and Dots. You can ask Alexa questions, you can use routines and skills and you can view Alexa enabled cameras and work Alexa enabled smart devices. I have used those features myself on the portal. You can use Alexa to play your Spotify, Iheartradio, Amazon music or Pandora accounts. If you don't have those accounts, Iheartradio is the best free one because as of right now, there is no sign in to use it and it does have advertisment. If you are not a Prime member, you can still use Alexa, just download the Alexa app to your phone, not the Amazon Prime App unless you are a paid Prime member. I have both on my phone because I am a Prime member. The browser is powered by Google and there are some limitations. You can't use the Facebook camera or microphone on websites. You can watch Youtube videos, you can go to the Amazon website, sign in and watch Prime Videos if you are a Prime member. You can watch movies on the Disney+, Hulu, HBOMax and Philo websites, if you pay for those services. I have also done that on the browser. You can't watch Netflix on the browser because Netflix doesn't allow it. It will only play trailers. A Netflix app may be coming soon on the FB Portal. You can use the browser to shop, sign in to email accounts, watch your local live news at their websites, watch Youtube or listen to Youtube music with or without a subscription. Just think of it as an extra TV or non portable laptop. You just can't download or upload to the FB Portal. Now for Non Facebook users. I have another 1st Gen Portal that is no longer connected to Facebook (mainly because I want to use it for entertainment outside) so this option is for you. I used the WhatsApp sign in to activate that Portal. You can only voice and video chat with WhatsApp users (no one really calls me on that app anymore). You cannot use any Facebook features. You can activate Amazon Prime if you are a member and still watch Prime Videos on the browser along with what I mentioned above. You can use Alexa to play your Spotify, Iheartradio, Amazon music or Pandora accounts or use Iheartradio no sign in. Use the browser like I mentioned above and Alexa. I love the FB Portal because it's cheaper than a laptop and I just wanted something to do the bare minimal and I didn't want a tablet either.

The problem is, it's a product by Facebook who is only really known for their social media application, not for specialized hardware devices. And there's a world of difference between those two worlds. As applications go social media applications are not terribly demanding nor highly sophisticated programs compared to many other applications. Especially when they're written in such a way as to function in the browser world. Specialized hardware applications, on the other hand, must take into account not only the dedicated application that runs on it, but also the hardware and device interfaces that allow it to connect the the outside world. This is the stuff that can become very tricky when trying to make those complex hardware interactions appear to be very simple and bulletproof. Given how easily this type of thing has become in these day of WiFi connected smartphones, computers, laptops, and streaming devices it's easy to overlook that complexity unless you've been in the hardware world for a while. And this is where this device fails. Right out of the box when this device fires up it presents the user with a list of available WiFi connections. You select the one you want and you're asked to enter your password for that network. It sounds simple, but if it fails you don't get much information about why it failed, so troubleshooting it is a problem. The device doesn't come with any information about where to call for support, so unless you know how to do a Google search and find the support site, you're stuck. Once you get in touch with the support line they run you through some very simplistic troubleshooting steps such as a reset of the device and power cycling your WiFi router (which affects anyone or anything else that happens to be using that router at the time). After those few simple steps it gets beyond what the first level of support can provide and they escalate it to the more advanced support group who, in my case, simply emailed me to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement. Given this experience I determined they really weren't ready to be operating in today's more sophisticated hardware environment quite yet and simply sent it back for a refund. The device came with very little in the way of documentation of support information. If you're trying to make it appear to be simple, then it must be bulletproof. Otherwise, it's just frustrating and not worth the time. Especially for the price they're asking for it.","","Not Ready For Prime Tme","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7UEYQZMZYG7PVO2KH47DYHMRCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=99&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BK5BXER7S4E9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The most practical use is with grandparents and grandchildren. Children may not like looking or talking into a small phone, the portal plus is a much more immersive experience. The revolutionary aspect of the device lies in the camera. The pans and zooms in very naturally, following multiple subjects on the screen at the same time. You really have to experience it to understand. There‚Äôs much more of a feeling that you‚Äôre right there with the other person than other forms of video chat. In my situation, have toddlers and use the portal plus to chat with our parents. Before, we‚Äôd have to chase the kids around with our phones. And echo show seemed like a good idea except it‚Äôs static. Worse than a phone for kids. With the portal plus, we can have it in the living room, and it can literally follow anyone in the living room to the kitchen. It‚Äôs REALLY COOL! Also, I know security is always an issue with these devices. It won‚Äôt satisfy all, but I like that you can easily turn off the mic and camera. It shows you a red light so you know they‚Äôre off. There is also a camera cover. This is more than most devices offer to protect your privacy. I haven‚Äôt tested many of the other features. You can watch YouTube, listen to pandora or Spotify. But I wouldn‚Äôt get this for those features. Again, if you have people you want to communicate with long distance. It‚Äôs a no brainer. Well worth $250.

The applications are limited, you cant even open Facebook on the app without using a Web Browser? Not really sure why that is the case... the applications you can download are VERY limited. However, if you are using this just as a communication platform with friends and family, its pretty good! The camera feature that follows and focuses in on you cant seem to be adjusted though unless you are in a certain mode. Its very annoying when you are speaking to someone and the camera sees your dog and then zooms in on the dogs or whatever. However, I do like the speakers and the Alexa integration, but seriously.. Facebook needs to put some Steve Jobs into this as it needs some TLC people! As I said, I had such high hopes for this and its a great start.... but just needs some extra something, especially for the cost. Just my 2 cents. It is a nice option for alexa and calling if you want it on your kitchen counter.. but to be a show stopper, it needs some work .. especially in the application aspect(s).

It has safety and sharing features built in, but no company is under scrutiny like Facebook, and that can‚Äôt be overlooked. For those concerned, there‚Äôs a lens cover included (but it‚Äôs not attached so could be lost, and is a bit cheap looking on an otherwise beautiful unit) and easy mute function. Blocking both film and audio is as simple as a tap in the middle of the top of the unit which stops audio and video communication. Features otherwise can be broken down into video calling, Alexa controls, and sound quality. With regard to video calling, this is where the portal most excels, but yet is most limited. The ability for the portal camera to zoom and track about the room is simply uncanny. You feel like you‚Äôre on a TV show, as the camera simply figures out the most appropriate look, giving an amazing feeling of connection with whom you‚Äôre calling. The large widescreen can be switched to vertical or horizontal orientation so the picture always fills the screen. There is an assortment of visual Add-ons during voice calls (available currently on Facebook messenger if you want to give them a test drive) such as turning yourself into a dragon, or a dancing strawberry, or the fun ability to read fairytale type book to the person on the other side. Our kids adored this. But speaking of kids, if this is in their reach, they are going to have access to your Facebook contacts, which could lead to some embarrassing accidental calls. With this quality comes the downside, as it can only connect with Facebook messenger users. With Facebook‚Äòs recent negative press and data breaches, it‚Äôs a hard sell to get your friends to reconnect with Facebook. Amazon is getting a firm foothold with their echo show and its ability for face-to-face calling, and this system‚Äôs lack of ability to contact those people has a huge detractor. Let me be clear, this unit can only be used to call via Facebook messenger. As far as its Alexa qualities, it‚Äôs nearly perfect. You use the portal commands (‚Äúhey Portal!‚Äù) for video calling, but most other features are run through Alexa commands. NOTE: You‚Äôll need to download the Alexa app for full functionality! It was relatively easy to set this up and within a few hours I was controlling my lights with voice commands. Alexa‚Äôs ability for downloadable games such as 20 questions or jeopardy were easily filtered and able to be used. I did have a few issues for the first few days with getting Alexa to hear my commands, but it seemed to adapt and now listens without concerns. Lastly, the sound quality is pretty stellar. It has solid base, akin to an Amazon echo, or even a Sonos speaker (Sonos is the easy leader in sound quality of the group, make no mistake). Listening to Amazon music is a joy but Spotify requires a premium membership for use. Most disappointingly, you cannot use Bluetooth speakers as extensions for multi room audio, but only Bluetooth connection to a single unit at a time which disables the Portal‚Äôs own speaker. I feel this is a huge detractor, and worthy of a loss of a ‚Äústar‚Äù on this alone. Overall, if you‚Äôre using this to call another portal, or someone on Facebook messenger, it‚Äôs an unbelievable piece of equipment. It‚Äôs ability to follow during phone calls, and it‚Äôs overall quality, blows the echo out of the water. It has the added advantage of many Alexa uses, but it, surely by design, doesn‚Äôt call other Echo Show units which is a huge hindrance. If you can get past the Facebook association, or if you are an active Facebook messenger user, this is a dream piece of technology which will be welcome in your home. If you don‚Äôt use Facebook and you don‚Äôt have many messenger contacts, this unit‚Äôs superior camera quality, beautiful bass, and immaculate screen might be wasted on you. Pros: Video calling quality is just beautiful, and the tracking feature gives an unbelievable sense of ‚Äúbeing there‚Äù Beautiful styling Cons: Must log in with Facebook No multiroom Bluetooth speaker support I hope this review was helpful.

Camera motion is really smooth and reliable and overall a great device that is optimized for video chat. Nails the call grandparents scenario for my kids. Cons: has to be plugged in. There's no battery. This is annoying. It's 2020 put a battery in it. You'd think this is obvious but it makes the device super lame that it has to be plugged in. UX can be clunky at times. We all naturally have a lot of Facebook friends but I don't want my son to accidentally dial a friend I haven't talked to in 10 years. The angle of the stand is a little off.

I started out with just the Portal. It had clear resolution and a good camera already. But I used it so much that I decided to upgrade to Portal Plus. It was well worth it only because I use it everyday to video call. Beyond that, it‚Äôs like a regular tablet with not many apps. SOUND The sound is MUCH better on the Portal Plus. It provides deeper bass. The regular Portal still has good sound too. But if you plan to use it for music, the Portal Plus is what I recommend as it is just one tier below an Echo in sound quality. Portal Plus wins by a large margin. VIDEO The Portal Plus provides a more clear picture while video calling. It almost feels as if the other person is right there. Portal Plus wins by a good margin (1080p vs 720p). CAMERA The camera is slightly bigger on the Portal Plus. From the other side of video calling, the person said it was maybe slightly better but hardly noticeable. Portal Plus barely wins. SCREEN SIZE Screen size on the Portal Plus is obviously bigger, however, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòenormously‚Äô bigger. The regular Portal will deliver enough for a good video calling experience. Portal Plus wins by a decent margin. OVERALL Get the Portal Plus over the Portal only if you plan to use it frequently. The price point is not worth it, otherwise.","","Portal vs Portal Plus","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNR7IO6YF4VEDHTLNNZXC34R47Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLXUD79OHKKDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The best thing is the sounds. I can hear the other side loud and clear through my TV's speaker and they can hear me as well even when I'm far from the device. My TV has hdmi-cec capability and it was able to switch to the correct hdmi input using the tv remote's home button so that's good. I do wish I could manually zoom the camera. Maybe that'll come in a future update. One of my favorite features is the ability to leave a 30 second voice message to any of my contacts without dialing. I wish they would extend that to a minute or two though. We use this to send a short personal greeting to families and friends during holidays and we can even use effects while we're at it. Lastly, if you're choosing among the Portal lineups, know that Portal TV so far has always been last to get new Portal features. I'm a member of the Facebook group and we like comparing notes there. While other Portals has the ability to change their backgrounds into those cool Zoom-like virtual backgrounds, this feature is not available yet to Portal TV as of July 1, 2020. I would still choose Portal TV though coz I like seeing my contacts in the big screen. I hope Facebook keeps improving this as it is definitely a winner.","","No manual zoom and no virtual backgrounds yet; otherwise excellent","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5T62UFSTSCG3BT55QUFFC76ASQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TOQOX6NK198W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

However, with the benefit of helping my homesick wife talk with her family in a convenient package kinda outweighed everything. The Portal Plus, is a great piece of tech, marred by sub-par software implementation. The main feature of the Portal Plus is video calling, it is center-stage. Performance is phenomenal and the ability for the camera to track your movement makes conversations feel dynamic. Most of my family and friends use facebook, so I am able to interact with them easily, and that is where the Portal Plus shines. Besides video calling, it features not much else. A handful of apps like Cooking and Spotify exist. Lacking any true developer backing leaves the Portal Plus feeling underutilized and a rush to market. Alexa is enabled but doesn't include the abilities of the Echo Show even though it features a beautiful screen. Granted the Portal Plus accomplishes its main goal gloriously, video calling, I believe it could be much more. Wonder what the future has in store for the Portal Plus. For now, we are happy with the video quality and ease of use but disappointed with the total features.","","Great when Homesick - Lacking features","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMCTOWA4Y7TVDDMMQB6PTBT7WTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C1UB8H23MMNX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

It's totally locked, so you can't add apps from other sources. You can't do anything with the Camera, it's only for calling someone on your Facebook friends list who also have to be on a mobile device or another portal, you can't communicate with a guy using Facebook from a laptop for example. You can't stream, take a picture, or use it as a mirror, because there's not camera app even. and the price, I got it on discount and I'd kill my self if I've bought it retail because it totally doesn't worth it. So again if you only want to video call someone who happen to have a portal, then this might be a good device for you if you intended to do a lot of video calls other wise don't bother.","","Very Limited...","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRZC4VYNB2DIGEFFKO55WX42Q3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=89&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12JY7JL84O8QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

I live in Chicago and my parents and sister in the UK. Mom is 88 and has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Dad is 90 and pretty fit and ""mostly"" with it, although has never used a touch screen before in his life. First I had to buy the folks a new cell phone that was able to download apps (they didn't have a smart phone) which was easy. Took their old one into the store where they bought it, upgraded to a Nokia 2.2 and they ported the number. Set that up with a new gmail address for Dad and downloaded Whats app. Didn't want to go the Facebook route as it seems like accounts get blocked if there is no other online presence, which there isn't. Added contacts to WhatsApp and tested all was working. Opened up the Portal. The 15"" Plus is big. Obviously 15"" screen, but then there's the base and camera on top, so close to 22"" tall. The base is deep too (about 6"" plus cable coming out of it, so placing on a mantelpiece probably won't work in most cases. Followed the on-screen instructions, connected to Wi-Fi and downloaded the latest software. Super easy. Next I added some contacts to favorites, and that was it. Increased font sizes, increased volume and done. What's great is that on the home screen, all that shows is the pictures of the favorite contacts. All Dad has to do it touch the screen, touch my icon, click video call and sit back. The call quality is amazing in both directions. They are both hard of hearing (Mum has two hearing aids) but have no problems with this. They can sit back in their chairs and still hear me, and I can hear them perfectly. I'd stopped calling them so often because it was so hard to get Mum to hear, now with this, I can chat every day. They don't have to hold a phone or worry about which buttons to press to put a phone on speaker. So simple and I can see how well they look (or not), see the flowers I sent etc. I still have can't believe the camera quality on this either. The way it widens to show the whole room when there's more than one person is incredible and when just one person is talking, it zooms in on them. Then widens when someone else joins the conversation. It's almost like being there. We have some care appointments set up for them this week and can't be there, but Dad will call us when the carer arrives and we can be in on the conversation. And yes, you can add other callers to the call, so both my sister and I can talk with Dad or the carer at the same time. I paid a little over the odds for it (not from Amazon) as I wanted it next day in the UK, but Amazon have it at a great price. Even at the price I paid, I'm totally satisfied. Sure it doesn't do that much, but what it does do, it does exceptionally well. If you're considering this as a tool to keep in touch with anyone, especially older folks, you won't regret it. Amazing!","","Great for the old folks","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6TS4WJGIVUMX5WXTXDMIX3MD4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVMFBTK0EHJHB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Well, this device can't even function as a decent clock. The screen is designed to completely turn off after the device has been idle for some time. Max, the device screen can stay idle for 1 hour, and after that screen goes dark. So the clock and photos on the screen go dark after the device has been idle for more than an hour. One of the reasons, I wanted to have a digital display is to see the time, when I wake up in the morning or walk in the room. With the portal, you have to either touch the screen to bring it out of idle state or say ""Hey portal tell the time"". After multiple exchanges with support and research online, I learned that the only way to have a persistent clock is to keep the camera shutter ON all the time. That way device will know using the camera that there are motion and activity and it comes out of idle state to display time. This is a really 'SNEAKY' thing on the part of FACEBOOK to make customers keep the camera on. When Google, Amazon, and many other similar devices can continue to display the clock, and photos in the idle state with the camera off, why Facebook can't do the same way. The only useful feature of this device is the quality of video calls. The device has native support for video calls via WhatsApp, and Facebook messenger. The smart camera automatically pans, zooms, and follows the user. This is a neat feature but Google and Amazon will catch up to this feature soon. After a few days of use, and getting frustrated with it and Facebook support, the Echo Show is back in my home office and the portal is back on facebook shelves. Pros - Native support for Whatsapp video calls, Facebook and zoom - Smart Camera that automatically pans and zooms.

It also does not allow for the YouTube app to be placed on it although the web browser will work, but it requires manual input rather than voice commands. I would‚Äôve saved my money and bought just a normal Alexa show had i known this. The Facebook video chats are very choppy and nowhere near as smooth as using our other devices for Facebook video chats. The device is also rather large so make sure you have a good space for it to sit. If you turn off the camera when not in use, it disables the microphone which stops the Alexa feature from working.

And even then it still has issues with cutting off people when they are the only ones talking and makes it difficult to have a conversation. You also can't have any other noise in the background else it cuts off the talking even more.

Raising this by 1-star. Previous review: Honestly, I‚Äôm still looking for a good use for this. Right now, it‚Äôs mainly used as a TV cam for WhatsApp meetings and for that it works pretty ok. Fun that the camera tracks, easy even for my kids to initiate the call. Mic sometimes has trouble picking up speech in our medium sized living room. Often does not hear my voice commands from a working distance; have to come up closer to it to pick up. Apps are minimal and this won‚Äôt be replacing our other streaming boxes- we have a smart TV and Fire box- and numerous echoes in the house so I did not bother linking this to my Netflix or Amazon accounts; because this does not yet have the Disney+ or YouTube apps, I will continue to depend on the others. Word of caution: this currently does NOT support Zoom; so forget using this for Zoom family meetings. The Amazon description lists Zoom as a partner but appears this applies for the Portal and not Portal TV; Amazon really should have a separate description (indeed, and reviews) for both items. Camera works well, easy to set up but as others have said- update takes time.

Also often the Portal Tv images don‚Äôt load and it‚Äôs hard to know who you are calling. No power button so this device uses electricity even when not in use. Also the device will make a noise if an incoming call and no way to turn off which is annoying if someone sleeping in room.

Cons.... 1. Many of my messenger contacts were missing. After troubleshooting, I discovered that Portal TV has a 50-contact maximum (at least for Messenger, not sure about WhatsApp as I have less than 50 contacts for WhatsApp, but more than 50 on Messenger). So I was looking for certain people on Messenger and they were not listed, but you are able to manually search for them with the Search tool and then add them to your ""Favorites"" You can also ""Hide"" Contacts from your main Messenger or WhatsApp list, for people that you never video chat with. It Facebook/Portal did not inform the public or myself, the consumer, about the 50-contact limit, and this led to confusion of why many contacts were not showing up. Hopefully they will read this and increase the limit, or at least inform the users of the limit. 2. When using Messenger to call someone on iPhone, there was problem where it only viewed in Portrait mode and would not rotate to Landscape no matter what the iPhone user did. Then calling that same person through WhatsApp, Landscape worked perfectly. So seems like there is a Messenger orientation issue when other party is using iPhone. Pros... 1. Has been working as expected and really makes a huge difference, it is much more relaxed to be able to use your TV to video chat, you can just hang out and it is just so much better than using a little phone, especially when there are more people involved, so you don't have to huddle around little phones all the time. -I would have given 5 stars, but deducted one because of the 50-contact maximum limit that was never communicated by Facebook/Portal TV. *****UPDATE APRIL 20, 2020 -I originally gave it 4 stars, and am reducing to 2 stars.

While I am not the primary user I will say that as someone on the other end of the call I appreciate the face tracking features. Any issue they ever had with it was external to the device (internet was out, power was not connected). When your portal TV is ""ringing"" it will make a sound and have a little light that will come on. The quality of the calls is good, however, it is subject to the quality of wifi callers have or data signal for those calling the portal using a phone connected via a cell tower. Camera quality is best in brightly lit rooms as with most cameras. I did have the benefit of setting it up and figuring it out for them in their home. When they bought a new TV it didn't have to be reconfigured, (plug and play).

The device has many very sensitive microphones and uses these to control the video auto-tracking and point the camera at the person talking. BUT, they are too sensitive to give good sound quality. This will be an issue for anyone with any type of hearing difficulty as I have and requires those without any hearing difficulty to concentrate on the sound as reported by others in my family having some difficulty. The microphones pick up every echo and noise in the room and transmit it to the person on the other end of the internet. As a result, when I listen to anyone using a portal they sound like they are in a hollow room, or tin can, or have a blanket over their head. The portal and its software does not distinguish between echos off surfaces and has no noise cancellation. When the room people are in is large and/or has many hard surfaces it is worse but even when someone is in a normal size room with normal wall hangings and furniture it is still an issue. It has nothing to do with my sound system when I am listening to someone. I know this because the same thing was happening when we were on vacation at an Airbnb and now at home with 2 different sound systems. I know this because the tin can sound occurs only when someone in the conversation is using a portal and does not occur when the person at the other end of the call is using a phone or computer, or when one of my sons is using top of the line ear pods with built-in mic. Facebook needs to either - use the six mics to auto-track the cameras and use only one of the mics for the sound it transmits over the internet, use some intelligent software to process the sound, or use some kind of noise-canceling - or all three. I definitely do not recommend this for anyone with any kind of hearing difficulty. You will be greatly disappointed as I am.","","The sound quality is terrible!","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRRIGFG2FNAHNXYZOTOSZ7O2LWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H8Y14NBXQNNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

Tech support will tell you to turn all external speakers off and turn audio way down. Sort of makes the whole thing useless, doesn't it? - Only works with Facebook Messenger. What if you have people in your life that don't use Facebook? You're sunk. No support for any other video chat systems. I get that Facebook wants to promote their own dog food, but there are a lot of people out there that don't want to use Facebook / don't have a Facebook account.

As we've made the purchases we push through and use, and enjoy them... but I'd be hesitant to really recommend someone buy one... Next Generation maybe? Positives: Bought these for myself, mom, and sister, and father in law... We use it almost every weekend and love how it connects the family. We have young kids and the grandparents get to see them run around, and now the kids recognize their voice etc. After you're done its ALMOST like you sat next to them on the couch and had a good chat... Now very good during COVID isolation as well... The AR is fun for kids and adults and the story time thing is cool. Negatives: They had such a strong chance for a GREAT product, but the negatives are almost to the point where I'd be iffy about actually recommending this to someone. Making and Connecting on calls - Linking up multiple people is for some unknown reason, always a pain... You can sign in through Facebook Messenger AND/OR WhatsApp... BUT if you want too add people to calls they need to be signed into the same thing (Messenger or Whatsapp), and you can only ADD someone to call, you can't combine a received call... I bought the ones that hookup to your TV, so I'll admit this is partially due to that, but you effectively need to call ahead, make sure everyone has their TV's to the right input, and is signed into the right service. As my sister said this morning, you come near to starting a family fight while trying to get the call going asking why someone isnt signed into the right service (see below). Also while combining calls (specifically for having 3 people on a call, it just shows the middle of the field of view of the camera and cuts off the sides... My mom inevitably can only see me in the center of the picture and misses my kids running around, and I in turn see my mom well centered, but only see my sisters cat which is situated between her and her husband... Set-up - It should be easy, but its not... Initial set up is KIND OF intuitive, but its not as simple as many other things... Its not impossible, and even after initial set up things don't always seem to stick... I (the tech knowledgeable 30 something) inevitably spend sometime face-timing or phoning the person on the other end to help them re-sign into something (even I've experienced being randomly signed out of profiles). Image Quality, Zoom, and following - We're all used to HD or 4K... and this is definitely not that quality... In a wide field of view the 12 mp camera does fine BUT when it ""Zooms"" in on you its only digital zoom so picture quality degrades quickly... The camera follows you nicely for big motions but sometimes seems to kind of have some ADD and randomly goes ""Squirrel!"" and zooms to another part of the room or just decides it doesn't like someone and won't include them in the picture... You can choose someone for the camera to focus on, but honestly having the OPTION just being able to manually control where the camera is looking would be super nice.. AR only tracks (3) faces which is kinda lack luster... even in a family of 4 someone is left out...","","I WANT to love this thing, but they make it sooo hard...","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMJU2UK5LXOYKUOAEX2ZCDO47JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=76&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPFGQEO0JT2IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

The other problem is that the advertisement Shows an easy step by step recipe helper, but does not work. Lastly even though it resembles a android tablet you cannot download a lot of the apps and cannot use other apps such as WhatsApp.","","Needs a lot of improvements","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5N7VEMAOLAURF2M77R6IASEMOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=93&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VMLARYUDLVF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"

We tried for hours to get this to work with a smart tv with external speakers but the caller always had an echo that made the calls completely unusable. This problem seems unsolved based on many online complaints. I would not recommend if you have external speakers. Also it is quite limited to facebook conferencing apps which forces you to use those accounts. The video quality was exceptional on a 4k tv and the built in tracking was great (it followed people as they moved around the kitchen for example). A great view into the future but hopefully someone will fix the audio problems and make a more open system.","","Does not work with external speakers - echo","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGM4Q2AH3KJPOGAYHSY3RRDF2VFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07XPDYRRJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=recent&reviewerType=all_reviews","Facebook","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R253P0932SM1GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XPDYRRJ","B07XPDYRRJ"
